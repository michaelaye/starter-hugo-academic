              We find features in far-IR emissivity (50--400 $\mu$m) could be

              pressures similar to those in Martian polar areas, observed the

              properties. Most importantly, we find that under conditions usual
              for Martian polar areas in fall and winter, CO2 ice always
              deposits as a translucent slab. The maximum thickness of the ice
              that we have achieved approached 2 cm and this CO2 slab ice layer

  abstract = "Araneiforms are radially converging systems of branching troughs
              exhibiting fractal properties. They are found exclusively in the
              Southern polar regions of Mars and believed to be result of
              multiple repetitions of cold CO2 gas jets eruptions. Araneiform
              troughs get carved by the overpressurized gas rushing underneath
              a seasonal ice layer towards a newly created opening. Current
              work is an attempt to quantitatively analyze araneiforms patterns
              and model their formation mechanism. Araneiform shapes range from
              small and simple structures of one or two connected branches to
              intricate dendritic patterns several kilometers across. The
              dendritic quality of most araneiforms are suggestive that they
              can be described in terms commonly applied to terrestrial rivers.
              The main difference between rivers and araneiforms from the
              morphological point of view is that araneiform patterns are not
              directed or in any way influenced by the local gravitational
              gradient. We have adapted and for the first time applied to
              Martian araneiforms qualitative morphological analysis typically
              used for terrestrial rivers. For several locations in the Martian
              Southern polar regions we have calculated the largest order of
              tributaries, tributary densities, and bifurcation ratios. We have
              shown that the large and well-developed araneiforms (with
              tributary orders larger than 4) closely follow Horton's law of
              tributary orders and have bifurcation ratio that falls well
              inside the range of terrestrial rivers. We have implemented a
              two-dimensional Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) model that
              describes formation of dendrite shapes by mathematical
              probabilistic means. We compared modeled dendrite shapes to the
              araneiform shapes observed in the Martian polar regions and
              evaluated their similarity using the morphological analysis of
              araneiforms. We showed that DLA model can successfully recreate
              2D shapes of different observed araneiforms. To simulate the
              patterns that deviate from central symmetry it is required to
              modify the main governing parameter of DLA model: its
              two-dimensional probability field. An analog to the governing
              probability field in the case of araneiforms is the gas pressure
              in the cavity underneath the ice layer right before the gas
              starts moving towards the newly created escape vent. Thus
              modeling the creation of araneiform patterns with DLA leads to
              better understanding of seasonal processes that create them.",

  abstract = "Here we report on the detection of new dendritic troughs created
              by the seasonal CO2 jet activity over several Martian years.
              According to Kieffers hypothesis (Kieffer, 2007) in Martian polar
              areas seasonal CO2 ice sublimation creates gas jets that deposit
              fans of mineral dust and sand on top of the CO2 ice. These jets
              and the related sub-ice gas flows are believed to carve troughs
              in the underlying polar deposits which, after multiple
              repetitions of this process throughout Martian spring seasons,
              create araneiform terrains. The High Resolution Imaging Science
              Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
              detected the new troughs during its campaign for seasonal
              monitoring of the polar areas. The newly detected dendritic
              troughs are small shallow branching troughs ($\approx$ 1.4 m
              wide) similar to the seasonal furrows previously detected in the
              northern hemisphere (Bourke, 2013). The essential difference
              between the new troughs and furrows lies in the fact that the
              troughs in the south are persistent while the northern furrows
              are erased each Martian year by the sand movement due to summer
              winds. From year to year the new southern troughs extend and
              develop new tributaries and their overall geometry turns from
              linear to dendritic, a characteristic shared with araneiform
              terrains. We believe that furrows have the same origin as the
              southern dendritic troughs but do not develop into dendritic
              shapes because of the high mobility of the dune material into
              which they are carved. Several locations where new dendritic
              troughs are observed lie in the vicinity of dunes. This gives us
              an observational indication that presence of erosive sand
              material is an important factor in creating (or at least
              starting) erosive processes that lead to the formation of
              dendritic troughs. By extrapolation the same mechanism should be
              acting to create the much larger araneiform terrains. Detection
              of the present day erosion working in polar areas and creating
              new topographical features is important for understanding of the
              processes that shape polar areas. Several years of HiRISE
              observations provide us with the information about the current
              rate of erosion and hence help estimate minimum ages of the
              araneiforms and the surface into which they are carved to be 1.3

              returned by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment aboard NASA's
              Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The need to minimize data volume
              and processing time in production of science-ready map products
              is increasingly important with the growth in data volume of
              planetary datasets. Diviner makes on average >1400 observations
              per second of radiance that is reflected and emitted from the
              lunar surface, using 189 detectors divided into 9 spectral
              channels. Data management and processing bottlenecks are
              amplified by modeling every observation as a probability
              distribution function over the field of view, which can increase
              the required processing time by 2--3 orders of magnitude.
              Geometric corrections, such as projection of data points onto a
              digital elevation model, are numerically intensive and therefore
              it is desirable to perform them only once. Our approach reduces
              bottlenecks through parallel binning and efficient storage of a
              pre-processed database of observations. Database construction is
              via subdivision of a geodesic icosahedral grid, with a spatial
              resolution that can be tailored to suit the field of view of the
              observing instrument. Global geodesic grids with high spatial
              resolution are normally impractically memory intensive. We
              therefore demonstrate a minimum storage and highly parallel
              method to bin very large numbers of data points onto such a grid.
              A database of the pre-processed and binned points is then used
              for production of mapped data products that is significantly
              faster than if unprocessed points were used. We explore quality
              controls in the production of gridded data records by conditional
              interpolation, allowed only where data density is sufficient. The
              resultant effects on the spatial continuity and uncertainty in
              maps of lunar brightness temperatures is illustrated. We identify
              four binning regimes based on trades between the spatial
              resolution of the grid, the size of the FOV and the on-target
              spacing of observations. Our approach may be applicable and
              beneficial for many existing and future point-based planetary

  abstract = "We present a method for calibrating images acquired by the Dawn
              Framing Camera (FC) that is based on the results of an in-flight
              calibration campaign performed during the cruise from Earth to
              Vesta. We describe this campaign and the data analysis in full.
              Both the primary camera FC2 and the backup camera FC1 are
              radiometrically and geometrically calibrated through observations
              of standard stars, star fields, and Solar System objects. The
              calibration in each spectral filter is accurate to within a few
              percent for point sources. Geometric distortion, small by design,
              is characterized with high accuracy. Dark current, monitored on a
              regular basis, is very low at flight operational temperatures.
              Out-of-field stray light was characterized using the Sun as a
              stray light source. In-field stray light is confirmed in
              narrow-band filter images of Vesta. Its magnitude and
              distribution are scene-dependent, and expected to contribute
              significantly to images of extended objects. Description of a
              method for in-field stray light correction is deferred to a
              follow-up paper, as is a discussion of the closely related topic
              of flat-fielding.",

              was observed with Enceladus at an orbital longitude near apoapsis

              diurnally, similar to ice particles. The occultation showed that
              the bulk water vapor emanating from Enceladus changes little with
              orbital position. The amount of gas in at least one supersonic
              jet increased significantly, implying that the increase in the
              number of particles lofted at apoapsis could be due to more gas
              coming from the supersonic jets and not the overall gas flux from
              the tiger stripe fissures that cross Enceladus' south polar
              region.",
