  abstract  = "The Diviner Radiometer on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)
               is measuring surface temperatures in 7 different thermal
               channels, 4 of them in the wavelength area classically defined
               as far infrared, starting at 13 microns, and ending with the
               longest wavelength channel at 400 microns. The surface
               temperatures derived from these thermal infrared measurements at
               the lunar poles indicate some of the coldest temperatures
               measured in the solar system of around 20 K. This work aims to
               disprove the null hypothesis that other effects like wavelength
               and temperature dependent emissivities are responsible for a
               reduced radiant exitance and the subsequently low derived
               surface temperature. To address the wavelength dependency of
               emissivity we are comparing nighttime temperatures over time
               (cooling curves) in between the different far infrared channels
               at selected locations. The locations have to be selected for low
               rock abundance to minimize anisothermality effects influencing
               the cooling curves. For this we are applying the method of lunar
               surface rock abundance using Diviner data as described in
               Bandfield et al. (2011), that has not been done so far at
               latitudes poleward of 60°. To avoid the large influence of
               slopes on the surface temperatures, the main reason for the
               latitude restriction in Bandfield et al. (2011) we use recent
               LOLA altimeter data to resolve any slopes that could influence
               the cooling curve at a chosen location. Having selected a
               location relatively free of anisothermalities and taking their
               effect into account, general differences in the cooling curves
               of the different Diviner wavelengths are interpreted as
               wavelength-dependent emissivities. To address the potential
               temperature dependency of emissivity, we are studying how the
               parameters of a mid-temperature range exponential fit to the
               cooling curve fit from approx. 250 to 70K, where we do not
               expect a temperature dependence of emissivity, extends to
               highest and lowest temperatures at the poles. Failure to make
               the high or low ends of the cooling curve fit to the
               extrapolated shape of the mid-temperature curve indicates a
               change of emissivity. Lastly, these studies should compare
               locations where we expect a potential emissivity effect from
               surface frosts. Chosen locations close to each other and under
               the assumption of comparable lateral heat conductivity at these
               close locations, surface deposits of ices should have a
               measurable effect on the emissivity. Studying this could further
               support two of Diviner's exciting hypotheses of water ice
               deposits in craters at the pole, and having measured some of the
               coldest temperature in the solar system.",

              {HiRISE} photometric analysis of evolution of northern polar
              dunes in spring",

  abstract = "We present an overview of our analyses of HiRISE observations of
              spring evolution of selected dune areas of the north polar erg.
              The north polar erg is covered annually by seasonal volatile ice
              layer, a mixture of CO2 and H2O with mineral dust contamination.
              In spring, this layer sublimes creating visually enigmatic
              phenomena, e.g. dark and bright fan-shaped deposits,
              dark--bright--dark bandings, dark down-slope streaks, and
              seasonal polygonal cracks. Similar phenomena in southern polar
              areas are believed to be related to the specific process of
              solid-state greenhouse effect. In the north, it is currently
              unclear if the solid-state greenhouse effect is able to explain
              all the observed phenomena especially because the increased
              influence of H2O on the time scales of this process has not yet
              been quantified. HiRISE observations of our selected locations
              show that the ground exhibits a temporal behaviour similar to the
              one observed in the southern polar areas: a brightening phase
              starting close to the spring equinox with a subsequent darkening
              towards summer solstice. The resolution of HiRISE enabled us to
              study dunes and substrate individually and even distinguish
              between different developments on windward and slip face sides of
              single dunes. Differences in the seasonal evolution between steep
              slip faces and flatter substrate and windward sides of dunes have
              been identified and compared to CRISM data of CO2 and H2O
              distributions on dunes. We also observe small scale dark blotches
              that appear in early observations and tend to sustain a low
              reflectivity throughout the spring. These blotches can be
              regarded as the analogue of dark fan deposits in southern polar
              areas, leading us to the conclusion that both martian polar areas
              follow similar spring evolutions.",

              seven regions of interest at high latitudes in the Northern polar
              regions of Mars. These data allow us to investigate the temporal
              evolution of the composition of the seasonal ice cap during
              spring, with a special emphasis on peculiar phenomena occurring
              in the dune fields and in the vicinity of the scarps of the North
              Polar Layered Deposits (NPLDs). The strength of the spectral
              signature of CO2 ice continuously decreases during spring whereas
              the one of H2O ice first shows a strong increase until Ls = 50°.
              This evolution is consistent with a scenario previously
              established from analysis of OMEGA data, in which a thin layer of
              pure H2O ice progressively develops at the surface of the
              volatile layer. During early spring (Ls < 10°), widespread jet
              activity is observed by HiRISE while strong spectral signatures
              of CO2 ice are detected by CRISM. Later, around Ls = 20-40°,
              activity concentrates at the dune fields where CRISM also detects
              a spectral enrichment in CO2 ice, consistent with ``Kieffer's
              model'' (Kieffer, H.H. [2007]. J. Geophys. Res. 112, E08005.
              doi:10.1029/2006JE002816) for jet activity. Effects of wind are
              prominent across the dune fields and seem to strongly influence
              the sublimation of the volatile layer. Strong winds blowing down
              the scarps could also be responsible for the significant spatial
              and temporal variability of the surface ice composition observed
              close to the NPLD.",

              CO2 slab ice. The observations by the High Resolution Imaging
              Science Experiment (HiRISE) of polar regions of Mars show very
              narrow dark elongated linear patterns that are observed during
              some periods of time in spring, disappear in summer and re?appear
              again in the following spring. They are repeatedly formed in the
              same areas but they do not repeat the exact pattern from year to
              year. This leads to the conclusion that they are cracks formed in
              the seasonal ice layer. Some of models of seasonal surface
              processes rely on the existence of a transparent form of CO2 ice,
              so?called slab ice. For the creation of the observed cracks the
              ice is required to be a continuous media, not an agglomeration of
              relatively separate particles like a firn. The best explanation
              for our observations is a slab ice with relatively high
              transparency in the visible wavelength range. This transparency
              allows a solid state green?house effect to act underneath the ice
              sheet raising the pressure by sublimation from below. The trapped
              gas creates overpressure and the ice sheet breaks at some point
              creating the observed cracks. We show that the times when the

              appearance and composition of 12 regions of the south polar
              layered deposits from spring to summer time. We distinguish three
              steps in the evolution of the volatile layer: a decrease of both
              CO2 band strength and albedo until Ls = 190°?210°, a significant
              increase in both until Ls = 240°?260° and finally a rapid
              decrease until the complete defrosting of the ground. In
              contrast, the water ice band displays a more monotonic decrease.
              Analysis of HiRISE color images acquired simultaneously with
              CRISM data allows a plausible interpretation of this evolution.
              In early springtime (Ls < 200°), intense jet activity results in
              deposition of fans of large mineral grains and a wide spatial
              distribution of fine grains. The small?scale topography controls
              the presence and location of the jets by allowing more solar
              energy to be collected on slopes. Grains from the dust fans warm
              and sink through the CO2 layer, resulting in a bluish color at
              the locations of the fans around Ls = 190°?210°. As the
              atmosphere warms up, the surface of the ice layer sublimes and
              releases dust and water, resulting in its brightening. The last
              phase of the process consists in a progressive defrosting

                spectral information from CRISM is available to gain insight
                into the composition and physical state of the surface. In the
                north polar areas, there are active regions. Here, dark dunes
                extend almost circumferen-tially around the permanent polar
                cap. This area exhibits phenomena similar to those observed in
                south polar areas in southern spring. Among these phenomena are
                cracks in a translucent ice layer which are considered to be
                manifestations of ice damage by increasing pressure at the
                interface between the ice layer and substrate underlying it
                [1]. Bright and dark fans, attributed to cold jet activity, are
                also observed on top of dunes [2]. The presence of these
                features indi-cates that dunes are covered by a conformal ice
                layer and that this layer is at least partially transparent to
                solar radiation. CO2 ice sublimation and processes connected to
                it appear to produce a variety of observable features. Yet
                another distinctive feature observed in this area (and rarely
                present in the south) is the presence of dark slope streaks on
                dunes. They originate from the crests of dunes and run down
                following the gravitational potential. They lengthen as the
                season progresses. Their origin has been discussed to be
                possible liquid brine flows [3, 4]. In the present work we
                report on indications that these slope streaks are instead dry
                mass wasting process. Due to geometry of solar illumination at
                local latitude the energy input on the crest is higher than in
                the valley between dunes. The ice cover thins most quickly in
                areas closest to the crest. In addition, applying stress
                distribution calculations to the conformal ice layer on
                realistic dune geometry, we show that the crest of the dune is
                the weakest point for the ice bending stress. The rupture of
                the ice layer therefore happens close to the dune's crest on
                the slip face and is followed by the escape of dry dune
                material from its top layer downslope. Streaks are overlaid on
                the ice layer and produce the observed contrast changes.
                Seasonal lengthening of the streaks can be attributed to the
                repeatability of this process when more and more dune material
                gets freed from the ice layer. An enhancement of this effect
                can occur if the rupture of the ice layer gives rise to an
                escape of gas trapped under it. The gas pressure, in this case,
                is produced by the same process that is proposed for araneiform
                formation in south polar areas [5]. Gas movement mobilises fine
                dune material and transports it towards the slip slope
                whereupon it runs down the slope. The described model does not
                involve liquid flows but is nonetheless fully consistent with
                HiRISE observations of this phenomenon. [1] G. Portyankina et

                Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has been used to monitor the
                seasonal evolution of several regions at high southern
                latitudes. Of particular interest have been jet-like activities
                that may result from the process described by Kieffer (2007),
                involving translucent CO2 ice. These jets are assumed to create
                fan-shaped ground features, as studied e.g. in Hansen et.al.
                (2010) and Portyankina et.al. (2010). In Thomas et.al. (2009),
                a small region of interest (ROI) inside the south polar Inca
                City region (81° S, 296° E) was defined for which the seasonal
                change of the number of fans was determined. This ROI was
                chosen for its strong visual variability in ground features.
                The mostly manual counting work showed, that the number of
                apparent fans increases monotonously for a considerable amount
                of time from the beginning of the spring time observations at
                Ls of 178° until approx. 230° , following the increase of
                available solar energy for the aforementioned processes of the
                Kieffer model. This fact indicates that the number of visual
                fan features can be used as an activity measure for the
                seasonal evolution of this area, in addition to commonly used
                evolution studies of surface reflectance. Motivated by these
                results, we would like to determine the fan count evolution for
                more south polar areas like Ithaca, Manhattan, Giza and others.
                To increase the reproducibility of the results by avoiding
                potential variability in fan shape recognition by human eye and
                to increase the production efficiency, efforts are being
                undertaken to automise the fan counting procedure. The
                techniques used, cleanly separated in different stages of the
                procedure, the difficulties for each stage and an overview of
                the tools used at each step will be presented. After showing a
                proof of concept in Aye et.al. (2010), for a ROI that is
                comparable to the one previously used for manual counting in
                Thomas et.al. (2009), we now will show results of these
                semi-automatically determined seasonal fan count evolutions for
                Inca City, Ithaca and Manhattan ROIs, compare these
                evolutionary patterns with each other and with surface
                reflectance evolutions of both HiRISE and CRISM for the same
                locations. References: Aye, K.-M. et. al. (2010), LPSC 2010,

                layer during winter, become in spring a place for exotic
                activity and a place of CO2, water ice and dust interplay. Dark
                and bright fans have been observed. They are associated with
                araneiform (spider-like) structures and are believed to be
                deposits from jets which arise from pressure produced below
                translucent CO2 slab ice. The High Resolution Imaging Science
                Experiment (HiRISE) has imaged the southern polar terrain in
                unprecedented detail throughout local spring of Martian year
                28. At the moment (beginning of 2009) a similar observational
                campaign for the southern spring of Martian year 29 is being
                conducted. We will present HiRISE observations for two chosen
                locations that exhibit jet activity - the Giza region (-84.8,
                65.7E) and Inca City (-81.3, 295.8E) - and compare their early
                spring evolution. Although these two areas are situated at
                similar latitudes, they lie on opposite sides of the South Pole
                and are topographically quite different: Giza occupies a
                relatively flat area, while Inca City possesses a distinctive
                set of orthogonal ridges. The most important difference is the
                relation of these regions to the cryptic terrain. OMEGA
                observations suggest Inca City lies completely outside the
                cryptic terrain, while Giza is inside the early cryptic region
                (at Ls=220 deg-230 deg). Similarities and differences in the
                evolution of these areas will be discussed on the basis of

              emission of the binary system PSR B1259-63/SS 2883 of a radio
              pulsar orbiting a massive, luminous Be star in a highly eccentric
              orbit. The observations around the 2004 periastron passage of the
              pulsar were performed with the four 13 m Cherenkov telescopes of
              the HESS experiment, recently installed in Namibia and in full
              operation since December 2003. Between February and June 2004, a
              $\gamma$-ray signal from the binary system was detected with a
              total significance above 13$\sigma$. The flux was found to vary
              significantly on timescales of days which makes PSR B1259-63 the
              first variable galactic source of VHE $\gamma$-rays observed so
              far. Strong emission signals were observed in pre- and
              post-periastron phases with a flux minimum around periastron,
              followed by a gradual flux decrease in the months after. The
              measured time-averaged energy spectrum above a mean threshold
              energy of 380 GeV can be fitted by a simple power law F\_0(E/1

              This detection of VHE $\gamma$-rays provides unambiguous evidence
              for particle acceleration to multi-TeV energies in the binary
              system. In combination with coeval observations of the X-ray
              synchrotron emission by the RXTE and INTEGRAL instruments, and
              assuming the VHE $\gamma$-ray emission to be produced by the
              inverse Compton mechanism, the magnetic field strength can be
              directly estimated to be of the order of 1 G.",

              neutron star or stellar-mass black hole. Radio and x-ray
              observations have led to the presumption that some x-ray binaries
              called microquasars behave as scaled-down active galactic nuclei.
              Microquasars have resolved radio emission that is thought to
              arise from a relativistic outflow akin to active galactic nuclei
              jets, in which particles can be accelerated to large energies.
              Very high energy gamma-rays produced by the interactions of these
              particles have been observed from several active galactic nuclei.
              Using the High Energy Stereoscopic System, we find evidence for
              gamma-ray emission of >100 gigaelectron volts from a candidate
              microquasar, LS 5039, showing that particles are also accelerated
              to very high energies in these systems.",

              April and May 2004 with the fully operational High Energy
              Stereoscopic System (HESS) in Namibia. The observations were
              carried out at zenith angles of 60°-65°, which result in an
              average energy threshold of 1.5 TeV and a collection area
              reaching 2 km2 at 10 TeV. Roughly 7000 photons from Mkn 421 were
              accumulated with an average gamma-ray rate of 8 photons/min. The
              overall significance of the detection exceeds 100 standard
              deviations. The light-curve of integrated fluxes above 2 TeV
              shows changes of the diurnal flux up to a factor of 4.3. For
              nights of high flux, intra-night variability is detected with a
              decay time of less than 1 h. The time averaged energy spectrum is
              curved and is well described by a power-law with a photon index
              $\Gamma$=2.1$\pm$0.1stat$\pm$0.3sys and an exponential cutoff at

              spectral shape are detected with a spectral hardening as the flux
              increases. Contemporaneous multi-wavelength observations at lower
              energies (X-rays and gamma-rays above $\approx$300 GeV) indicate
              smaller relative variability amplitudes than seen above 2 TeV

              has been detected with high significance (˜45$\sigma$) at
              energies greater than 160 GeV, using the H.E.S.S. stereoscopic
              array of imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia. A strong
              signal is found in each of the data sets corresponding to the
              dark periods of July and October, 2002, and June-September, 2003.
              The observed flux of VHE gamma rays shows variability on time
              scales of months, days, and hours. The monthly-averaged integral
              flux above 300 GeV varies between 10\% and 60\% of the flux
              observed from the Crab Nebula. Energy spectra are measured for
              these individual periods of data taking and are characterized by
              a steep power law with a time-averaged photon index of
              $\Gamma$=3.32$\pm$0.06. An improved $\chi$2 per degree of freedom
              is found when either a power law with an exponential cutoff

              spectrum. However, the significance of the improvement is
              marginal (˜2$\sigma$). The suggested presence of features in the
              energy spectrum may be intrinsic to the emission from the blazar,
              or an indication of absorption of TeV gamma rays by the
              extragalactic infrared background light",

  abstract = "A significant fraction of the energy density of the interstellar
              medium is in the form of high-energy charged particles (cosmic
              rays). The origin of these particles remains uncertain. Although
              it is generally accepted that the only sources capable of
              supplying the energy required to accelerate the bulk of Galactic
              cosmic rays are supernova explosions, and even though the
              mechanism of particle acceleration in expanding supernova remnant
              (SNR) shocks is thought to be well understood theoretically,
              unequivocal evidence for the production of high-energy particles
              in supernova shells has proven remarkably hard to find. Here we
              report on observations of the SNR RX J1713.7 - 3946 (G347.3 -
              0.5), which was discovered by ROSAT in the X-ray spectrum and
              later claimed as a source of high-energy gamma-rays of TeV
              energies (1 TeV = 10(12) eV). We present a TeV gamma-ray image of
              the SNR: the spatially resolved remnant has a shell morphology
              similar to that seen in X-rays, which demonstrates that
              very-high-energy particles are accelerated there. The energy
              spectrum indicates efficient acceleration of charged particles to
              energies beyond 100 TeV, consistent with current ideas of
              particle acceleration in young SNR shocks.",

              observations of Cen X-3 taken by the University of Durham Mark 6
              imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope in 1997-1999. The
              presence of a TeV gamma -ray signal at the overall >= 4.5sigma
              significance level in the ``fully cut'' image selected data, as
              reported earlier, is confirmed. A search for possible modulations
              of gamma -rays with the pulsar spin period P0~ 4.8 s was
              performed by the step-by-step application of image parameter cuts
              of gradually increasing hardness. The data of each of 23 days of
              observations have not revealed any statistically significant
              Rayleigh power peak, except for 1 day when a peak with a chance
              probability p=6.8x 10-7 was found in ``soft-cut'' data sets. This
              modulation, if real, is blue shifted by 6.6 ms (>103 km s-1) from
              the nominal second harmonic of the X-ray pulsar. Taking the large
              number of frequency trials into account, the estimated final
              probability of finding such a peak by chance still remains = 100
              MeV) and very high energy (VHE, E>= 100 GeV) gamma -rays. We
              propose on the basis of the energetics required that all
              reasonable options for the gamma -ray production in Cen X-3 must
              be connected to jets emerging from the inner accretion disc
              around the neutron star. One of the principal options is a
              large-scale source, with R\_s ~ 1013 - 1014 cm; this assumes
              effective acceleration of electrons up to ~ 10 TeV by shocks
              produced by interaction of these jets with the dense atmosphere
              of the binary. It is shown that such a quasi-stationary model
              could explain the bulk of the gamma -radiation features observed
              except for the gamma -ray modulations with the pulsar spin. These
              modulations, if genuine, would require an alternative source with
              R\_s << 1011 cm. We consider two principal models, hadronic and
              leptonic, for the formation of such a compact source in the jet.
              Both models predict that the episodes of pulsed gamma -ray
              emission may be rather rare, with a typical duration not
              exceeding a few hours, and that generally the frequency of
              pulsations should be significantly shifted from the nominal
              frequency of the X-ray pulsar. The opportunities to distinguish
              between different models by means of future gamma -ray
              observations of this X-ray binary are also discussed.",

                telescope's field of view. These were combined with frequent
                measurements of the position of the brightest star in the field
                of view to calibrate absolute digital encoders on the telescope
                steering axes. The gravitational bending of the focal supports

                $\gamma$-ray production in Cen X-3 must be connected with jets
                emerging from the inner accretion disc of the neutron star. A
                large-scale quasi-stationary source (on a time scale of days or
                longer) powered by shocks driven by such jets into the Rs
                $\geq$ 1013 cm surrounding the binary could explain the bulk of
                the $\gamma$-radiation features, except for a modulation of the
                $\gamma$-ray signal with the pulsar spin period. These
                modulations, if genuine, would require an alternative source
                with Rs 1011 cm. We consider two principal models, hadronic and
                leptonic, for such a compact source in the jet. Both models
                predict that the pulsed $\gamma$-ray emission should be
                episodic, and can be expected only at the initial stages
                (typically less than a few hours) of powerful $\gamma$-ray
                flares, and that $\gamma$-ray pulsations should be
                significantly shifted from the pulsar frequency. Such a source
                would generally fade, due to expansion, in a few days.",

              pairs of telescopes of the HEGRA IACT system, the sensitivity of

              telescope spacing, ranging from 70 to 140 m. Data taken during

              after cuts to optimize the significance of signals. Detection
              rates decrease by about 1/3 between the minimum and maximum
