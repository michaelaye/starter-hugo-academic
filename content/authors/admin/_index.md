I am a research associate at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the 
University of Colorado, Boulder.
My research interests include planetary physics and machine learning for planetary science while 
enabling access and reproducibility of science with the means of Open Access, 
Open Science, and Open Source. 
I am the PI of a NASA proposal to create an updated version of the Cassini UVIS dataset, 
and a Co-I of several projects in the fields of polar Mars, Saturn rings, and Venus imaging science.
