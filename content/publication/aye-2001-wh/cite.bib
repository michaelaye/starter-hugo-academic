 abstract = {This paper describes the calibration system which has been
designed for the flat-fielding of the cameras of the Phase 1
H.E.S.S. telescopes. It employs a nitrogen laser with a pulse
length of 4 ns which is used to energise a scintillator. This
signal from the scintillator is then passed 50 m through
multimode graded index optical fibre to the dish centre from
where it illuminates uniformly the camera. Two system designs
are considered. Each design would have a dish centre unit which
provides a uniform light pulse for the camera calibration. The
first design places the laser in the electronics hut at the
telescope base, having four lasers for Phase 1, the second
design has one laser in the system's main control room with a
beam-splitter and long fibre cables to guide the light to the
DCUs of the Phase 1 telescopes.},
