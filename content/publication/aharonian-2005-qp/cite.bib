 abstract = {Very high energy (>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission has been detected
for the first time from the composite supernova remnant G 0.9+0.1
using the HESS instrument. The source is detected with a
significance of $≈$13$σ$, and a photon flux above 200
GeV of (5.7$±$0.7stat$±$1.2sys)$\times$10-12 cm-2 s-1, making
it one of the weakest sources ever detected at TeV energies. The
photon spectrum is compatible with a power law (dN/dE ∝
E-$Γ$) with photon index $Γ$ =
2.40$±$0.11stat$±$0.20sys. The gamma-ray emission appears to
originate in the plerionic core of the remnant, rather than the
shell, and can be plausibly explained as inverse Compton
scattering of relativistic electrons.},
