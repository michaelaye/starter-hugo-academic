 abstract = {We have designed and constructed an original facility to
characterize the VIS-NIR Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution
Function (BRDF) and some complementary bulk physical properties
of planetary analog samples containing water ice. The central
part of the facility is a highly accurate gonio-radiometer
(PHIRE-2) operating in the VIS-NIR spectral range (400-1100 nm)
installed in a large laboratory freezer. Its development was
based on the experience gained on the gonio-radiometer PHIRE-1
(Gunderson et al., 2006). The PHIRE-1 design was modified to
permit operations at sub-zero temperatures and to optimize the
performance of the instrument. The photometric measurements are
complemented by a detailed simultaneous characterization of the
physical state and possible temporal evolution of the samples
using a combination of macro- and micro-imaging, thermal,
electrical and sample mass measurements. The modified design will
support the interpretation of current and future remote sensing
and in-situ datasets on icy planetary objects with a special
emphasis on cometary nuclei, Martian polar regions and Jovian
satellites.},
