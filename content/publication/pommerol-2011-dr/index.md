abstract: We have designed and constructed an original facility to characterize the
  VIS-NIR Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and some complementary
  bulk physical properties of planetary analog samples containing water ice. The central
  part of the facility is a highly accurate gonio-radiometer (PHIRE-2) operating in
  the VIS-NIR spectral range (400-1100 nm) installed in a large laboratory freezer.
  Its development was based on the experience gained on the gonio-radiometer PHIRE-1
  (Gunderson et al., 2006). The PHIRE-1 design was modified to permit operations at
  sub-zero temperatures and to optimize the performance of the instrument. The photometric
  measurements are complemented by a detailed simultaneous characterization of the
  physical state and possible temporal evolution of the samples using a combination
  of macro- and micro-imaging, thermal, electrical and sample mass measurements. The
  modified design will support the interpretation of current and future remote sensing
  and in-situ datasets on icy planetary objects with a special emphasis on cometary
  nuclei, Martian polar regions and Jovian satellites.
