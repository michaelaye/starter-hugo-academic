abstract: The Durham Mark 6 Cherenkov telescope was established in Narrabri, NSW in
  1995. The resolution of sensing the pointing direction was designed to be Ëœ 1 arc-minute.
  The method used to calibrate and correct the pointing of the telescope in order
  to achieve an accuracy equivalent to the resolution is described in detail. A CCD
  camera was used to take regular images of the telescope's field of view. These were
  combined with frequent measurements of the position of the brightest star in the
  field of view to calibrate absolute digital encoders on the telescope steering axes.
  The gravitational bending of the focal supports was allowed for.
