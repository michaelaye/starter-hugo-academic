 abstract = {The Durham Mark 6 Cherenkov telescope was established in
Narrabri, NSW in 1995. The resolution of sensing the pointing
direction was designed to be Ëœ 1 arc-minute. The method used to
calibrate and correct the pointing of the telescope in order to
achieve an accuracy equivalent to the resolution is described
in detail. A CCD camera was used to take regular images of the
telescope's field of view. These were combined with frequent
measurements of the position of the brightest star in the field
of view to calibrate absolute digital encoders on the telescope
steering axes. The gravitational bending of the focal supports
was allowed for.},
