 abstract = {For stereoscopic systems of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes a key parameter to optimize the sensitivity for VHE
/$γ$-ray point sources is the intertelescope spacing. Using
pairs of telescopes of the HEGRA IACT system, the sensitivity of
two-telescope stereo IACT systems is studied as a function of the
telescope spacing, ranging from 70 to 140 m. Data taken during
the 1997 outburst of Mrk 501 are used to evaluate both the
detection rates before cuts, and the sensitivity for weak signals
after cuts to optimize the significance of signals. Detection
rates decrease by about 1/3 between the minimum and maximum
spacings. The significance of signals is essentially independent
of distance in the range investigated.},
