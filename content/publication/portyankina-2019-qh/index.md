abstract: "Araneiforms are radially converging systems of branching troughs exhibiting\
  \ fractal properties. They are found exclusively in the Southern polar regions of\
  \ Mars and believed to be result of multiple repetitions of cold CO2 gas jets eruptions.\
  \ Araneiform troughs get carved by the overpressurized gas rushing underneath a\
  \ seasonal ice layer towards a newly created opening. Current work is an attempt\
  \ to quantitatively analyze araneiforms patterns and model their formation mechanism.\
  \ Araneiform shapes range from small and simple structures of one or two connected\
  \ branches to intricate dendritic patterns several kilometers across. The dendritic\
  \ quality of most araneiforms are suggestive that they can be described in terms\
  \ commonly applied to terrestrial rivers. The main difference between rivers and\
  \ araneiforms from the morphological point of view is that araneiform patterns are\
  \ not directed or in any way influenced by the local gravitational gradient. We\
  \ have adapted and for the first time applied to Martian araneiforms qualitative\
  \ morphological analysis typically used for terrestrial rivers. For several locations\
  \ in the Martian Southern polar regions we have calculated the largest order of\
  \ tributaries, tributary densities, and bifurcation ratios. We have shown that the\
  \ large and well-developed araneiforms (with tributary orders larger than 4) closely\
  \ follow Horton's law of tributary orders and have bifurcation ratio that falls\
  \ well inside the range of terrestrial rivers. We have implemented a two-dimensional\
  \ Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) model that describes formation of dendrite\
  \ shapes by mathematical probabilistic means. We compared modeled dendrite shapes\
  \ to the araneiform shapes observed in the Martian polar regions and evaluated their\
  \ similarity using the morphological analysis of araneiforms. We showed that DLA\
  \ model can successfully recreate 2D shapes of different observed araneiforms. To\
  \ simulate the patterns that deviate from central symmetry it is required to modify\
  \ the main governing parameter of DLA model: its two-dimensional probability field.\
  \ An analog to the governing probability field in the case of araneiforms is the\
  \ gas pressure in the cavity underneath the ice layer right before the gas starts\
  \ moving towards the newly created escape vent. Thus modeling the creation of araneiform\
  \ patterns with DLA leads to better understanding of seasonal processes that create\
  \ them."
