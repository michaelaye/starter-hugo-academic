 abstract = {Araneiforms are radially converging systems of branching troughs
exhibiting fractal properties. They are found exclusively in the
Southern polar regions of Mars and believed to be result of
multiple repetitions of cold CO2 gas jets eruptions. Araneiform
troughs get carved by the overpressurized gas rushing underneath
a seasonal ice layer towards a newly created opening. Current
work is an attempt to quantitatively analyze araneiforms patterns
and model their formation mechanism. Araneiform shapes range from
small and simple structures of one or two connected branches to
intricate dendritic patterns several kilometers across. The
dendritic quality of most araneiforms are suggestive that they
can be described in terms commonly applied to terrestrial rivers.
The main difference between rivers and araneiforms from the
morphological point of view is that araneiform patterns are not
directed or in any way influenced by the local gravitational
gradient. We have adapted and for the first time applied to
Martian araneiforms qualitative morphological analysis typically
used for terrestrial rivers. For several locations in the Martian
Southern polar regions we have calculated the largest order of
tributaries, tributary densities, and bifurcation ratios. We have
shown that the large and well-developed araneiforms (with
tributary orders larger than 4) closely follow Horton's law of
tributary orders and have bifurcation ratio that falls well
inside the range of terrestrial rivers. We have implemented a
two-dimensional Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) model that
describes formation of dendrite shapes by mathematical
probabilistic means. We compared modeled dendrite shapes to the
araneiform shapes observed in the Martian polar regions and
evaluated their similarity using the morphological analysis of
araneiforms. We showed that DLA model can successfully recreate
2D shapes of different observed araneiforms. To simulate the
patterns that deviate from central symmetry it is required to
modify the main governing parameter of DLA model: its
two-dimensional probability field. An analog to the governing
probability field in the case of araneiforms is the gas pressure
in the cavity underneath the ice layer right before the gas
starts moving towards the newly created escape vent. Thus
modeling the creation of araneiform patterns with DLA leads to
better understanding of seasonal processes that create them.},
