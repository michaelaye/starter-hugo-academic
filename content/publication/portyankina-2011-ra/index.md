abstract: The model of processes involving basal sublimation of CO2 described in [4]
  has been further refined by introducing a more precise calculation of available
  solar energy depending on local topography (inclination effects) and neighboring
  terrain shadowing using ray-tracing. This model is now being adapted to describe
  northern circum-polar area activity. The application of our model to the northern
  polar areas (in addition to the southern) is justified by recent observations by
  Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter instruments (HiRISE and CRISM). Both polar regions have
  been repeatedly monitored during several spring seasons and the results of these
  observation campaigns lead to the conclusion that basal sublimation is active in
  both hemispheres.
