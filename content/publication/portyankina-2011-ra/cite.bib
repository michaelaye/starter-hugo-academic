 abstract = {The model of processes involving basal sublimation of CO2
described in [4] has been further refined by introducing a more
precise calculation of available solar energy depending on local
topography (inclination effects) and neighboring terrain
shadowing using ray-tracing. This model is now being adapted to
describe northern circum-polar area activity. The application of
our model to the northern polar areas (in addition to the
southern) is justified by recent observations by Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter instruments (HiRISE and CRISM). Both
polar regions have been repeatedly monitored during several
spring seasons and the results of these observation campaigns
lead to the conclusion that basal sublimation is active in both
hemispheres.},
