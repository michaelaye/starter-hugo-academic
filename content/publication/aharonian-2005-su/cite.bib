 abstract = {Observations of the shell-type supernova remnant SN1006 have been
carried out with the HESS system of Cherenkov telescopes during
2003 (18.2 h with two operating telescopes) and 2004 (6.3 h with
all four telescopes). No evidence for TeV $γ$-ray emission
from any compact or extended region associated with the remnant
is seen and resulting upper limits at the 99.9% confidence level
are up to a factor 10 lower than previously-published fluxes from
CANGAROO. For SN1006 at its current epoch of evolution we define
limits for a number of important global parameters. Upper limits
on the $γ$-ray luminosity (for E = 0.26 to 10 TeV, distance
d = 2 kpc) of L$γ$ 25 $μ$G results when considering the
synchrotron/inverse-Compton framework for the observed X-ray flux
and $γ$-ray upper limits.},
