 abstract = {The atmospheric Cherenkov telescope technique is unique in that
the atmosphere is an integral part of the detector. A realistic
goal for the next generation of telescopes is to make energy
assignments and flux determinations to better than 10%. We
discuss the requirements for atmospheric monitoring that will
be necessary to achieve this and look forward to how these
requirements can be implemented.},
