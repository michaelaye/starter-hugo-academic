abstract: The atmospheric Cherenkov telescope technique is unique in that the atmosphere
  is an integral part of the detector. A realistic goal for the next generation of
  telescopes is to make energy assignments and flux determinations to better than
  10%. We discuss the requirements for atmospheric monitoring that will be necessary
  to achieve this and look forward to how these requirements can be implemented.
