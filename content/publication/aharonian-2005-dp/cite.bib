 abstract = {The region around PSR B1706-44 has been observed with the HESS
imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in 2003. No evidence for
$γ$-ray emission in the TeV range was found at the pulsar
position or at the radio arc which corresponds to the supernova
remnant G 343.1-2.3. The 99% confidence level flux upper limit
at the pulsar position is Ful(E>350 GeV) = 1.4 $\times$ 10-12 s-1
cm-2 assuming a power law (dN/dE ∝ E-$Γ$) with photon index
of $Γ$ = 2.5 and Ful(E > 500 GeV) = 1.3 $\times$ 10-12 s-1
cm-2 without an assumption on the spectral shape. The reported
upper limits correspond to 8% of the flux from an earlier
detection by the CANGAROO experiment.},
