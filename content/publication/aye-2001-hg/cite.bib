 abstract = {Under certain circumstances, the geomagnetic field has been
demonstrated to cause distortions of the images of gamma rays
in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. Our previous
analysis of this effect has concentrated on telescopes with
characteristics typical of the Mark 6 telescope. We have
extended our simulations to telescopes with higher angular
resolution and lower energy threshold. We discuss the
implications of these results.},
