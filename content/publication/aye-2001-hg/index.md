abstract: Under certain circumstances, the geomagnetic field has been demonstrated
  to cause distortions of the images of gamma rays in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
  telescopes. Our previous analysis of this effect has concentrated on telescopes
  with characteristics typical of the Mark 6 telescope. We have extended our simulations
  to telescopes with higher angular resolution and lower energy threshold. We discuss
  the implications of these results.
