Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has been used to monitor the
seasonal evolution of several regions at high southern
latitudes. Of particular interest have been jet-like activities
that may result from the process described by Kieffer (2007),
involving translucent CO2 ice. These jets are assumed to create
fan-shaped ground features, as studied e.g. in Hansen et.al.
(2010) and Portyankina et.al. (2010). In Thomas et.al. (2009),
a small region of interest (ROI) inside the south polar Inca
City region (81째 S, 296째 E) was defined for which the seasonal
change of the number of fans was determined. This ROI was
chosen for its strong visual variability in ground features.
The mostly manual counting work showed, that the number of
apparent fans increases monotonously for a considerable amount
of time from the beginning of the spring time observations at
Ls of 178째 until approx. 230째 , following the increase of
available solar energy for the aforementioned processes of the
Kieffer model. This fact indicates that the number of visual
fan features can be used as an activity measure for the
seasonal evolution of this area, in addition to commonly used
evolution studies of surface reflectance. Motivated by these
results, we would like to determine the fan count evolution for
more south polar areas like Ithaca, Manhattan, Giza and others.
To increase the reproducibility of the results by avoiding
potential variability in fan shape recognition by human eye and
to increase the production efficiency, efforts are being
undertaken to automise the fan counting procedure. The
techniques used, cleanly separated in different stages of the
procedure, the difficulties for each stage and an overview of
the tools used at each step will be presented. After showing a
proof of concept in Aye et.al. (2010), for a ROI that is
comparable to the one previously used for manual counting in
Thomas et.al. (2009), we now will show results of these
semi-automatically determined seasonal fan count evolutions for
Inca City, Ithaca and Manhattan ROIs, compare these
evolutionary patterns with each other and with surface
reflectance evolutions of both HiRISE and CRISM for the same
locations. References: Aye, K.-M. et. al. (2010), LPSC 2010,
