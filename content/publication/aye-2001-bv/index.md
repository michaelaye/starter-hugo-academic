abstract: We report observations of the southern hemisphere TeV blazar PKS 2155-304
  made with the University of Durham Mark 6 Telescope during September, October and
  November 1999. No evidence of TeV gamma ray emission was found. RXTE observed PKS
  2155-304 at this time and showed no evidence for X-ray flaring. Our observations
  do not contradict the current models for TeV emission from blazars.
