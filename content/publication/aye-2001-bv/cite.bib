 abstract = {We report observations of the southern hemisphere TeV blazar
PKS 2155-304 made with the University of Durham Mark 6
Telescope during September, October and November 1999. No
evidence of TeV gamma ray emission was found. RXTE observed PKS
2155-304 at this time and showed no evidence for X-ray flaring.
Our observations do not contradict the current models for TeV
emission from blazars.},
