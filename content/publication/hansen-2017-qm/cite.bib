 abstract = {Abstract An occultation of $Îµ$ Orionis by Enceladus' plume
was observed with Enceladus at an orbital longitude near apoapsis
in order to investigate whether water vapor flow is modulated
diurnally, similar to ice particles. The occultation showed that
the bulk water vapor emanating from Enceladus changes little with
orbital position. The amount of gas in at least one supersonic
jet increased significantly, implying that the increase in the
number of particles lofted at apoapsis could be due to more gas
coming from the supersonic jets and not the overall gas flux from
the tiger stripe fissures that cross Enceladus' south polar
region.},
