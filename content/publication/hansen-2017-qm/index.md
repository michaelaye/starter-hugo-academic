abstract: Abstract An occultation of $Îµ$ Orionis by Enceladus' plume was observed
  with Enceladus at an orbital longitude near apoapsis in order to investigate whether
  water vapor flow is modulated diurnally, similar to ice particles. The occultation
  showed that the bulk water vapor emanating from Enceladus changes little with orbital
  position. The amount of gas in at least one supersonic jet increased significantly,
  implying that the increase in the number of particles lofted at apoapsis could be
  due to more gas coming from the supersonic jets and not the overall gas flux from
  the tiger stripe fissures that cross Enceladus' south polar region.
