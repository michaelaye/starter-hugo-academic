 abstract = {Observations of Centaurus X-3 were made by the University of
Durham Mark 6 telescope over a three year period from 1997 to
1999. A detailed timing analysis of the observations has been
performed. A search for modulation of the $γ$-ray signal
at the pulsar orbital period, as well as for any short-term
(few hours) episodes of $γ$-ray emission with a
periodicity near, but not necessarily coincident with, the
period of X-ray pulsations has been carried out. The results
are presented in the context of several possible emission
scenarios.},
