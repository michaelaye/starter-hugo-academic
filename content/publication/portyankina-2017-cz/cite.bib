 abstract = {Here we report on the detection of new dendritic troughs created
by the seasonal CO2 jet activity over several Martian years.
According to Kieffers hypothesis (Kieffer, 2007) in Martian polar
areas seasonal CO2 ice sublimation creates gas jets that deposit
fans of mineral dust and sand on top of the CO2 ice. These jets
and the related sub-ice gas flows are believed to carve troughs
in the underlying polar deposits which, after multiple
repetitions of this process throughout Martian spring seasons,
create araneiform terrains. The High Resolution Imaging Science
Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
detected the new troughs during its campaign for seasonal
monitoring of the polar areas. The newly detected dendritic
troughs are small shallow branching troughs ($â‰ˆ$ 1.4 m
wide) similar to the seasonal furrows previously detected in the
northern hemisphere (Bourke, 2013). The essential difference
between the new troughs and furrows lies in the fact that the
troughs in the south are persistent while the northern furrows
are erased each Martian year by the sand movement due to summer
winds. From year to year the new southern troughs extend and
develop new tributaries and their overall geometry turns from
linear to dendritic, a characteristic shared with araneiform
terrains. We believe that furrows have the same origin as the
southern dendritic troughs but do not develop into dendritic
shapes because of the high mobility of the dune material into
which they are carved. Several locations where new dendritic
troughs are observed lie in the vicinity of dunes. This gives us
an observational indication that presence of erosive sand
material is an important factor in creating (or at least
starting) erosive processes that lead to the formation of
dendritic troughs. By extrapolation the same mechanism should be
acting to create the much larger araneiform terrains. Detection
of the present day erosion working in polar areas and creating
new topographical features is important for understanding of the
processes that shape polar areas. Several years of HiRISE
observations provide us with the information about the current
rate of erosion and hence help estimate minimum ages of the
araneiforms and the surface into which they are carved to be 1.3
$\times$ 103 Martian years.},
