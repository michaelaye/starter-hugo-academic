abstract: Here we report on the detection of new dendritic troughs created by the
  seasonal CO2 jet activity over several Martian years. According to Kieffers hypothesis
  (Kieffer, 2007) in Martian polar areas seasonal CO2 ice sublimation creates gas
  jets that deposit fans of mineral dust and sand on top of the CO2 ice. These jets
  and the related sub-ice gas flows are believed to carve troughs in the underlying
  polar deposits which, after multiple repetitions of this process throughout Martian
  spring seasons, create araneiform terrains. The High Resolution Imaging Science
  Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) detected the new troughs
  during its campaign for seasonal monitoring of the polar areas. The newly detected
  dendritic troughs are small shallow branching troughs ($â‰ˆ$ 1.4 m wide) similar to
  the seasonal furrows previously detected in the northern hemisphere (Bourke, 2013).
  The essential difference between the new troughs and furrows lies in the fact that
  the troughs in the south are persistent while the northern furrows are erased each
  Martian year by the sand movement due to summer winds. From year to year the new
  southern troughs extend and develop new tributaries and their overall geometry turns
  from linear to dendritic, a characteristic shared with araneiform terrains. We believe
  that furrows have the same origin as the southern dendritic troughs but do not develop
  into dendritic shapes because of the high mobility of the dune material into which
  they are carved. Several locations where new dendritic troughs are observed lie
  in the vicinity of dunes. This gives us an observational indication that presence
  of erosive sand material is an important factor in creating (or at least starting)
  erosive processes that lead to the formation of dendritic troughs. By extrapolation
  the same mechanism should be acting to create the much larger araneiform terrains.
  Detection of the present day erosion working in polar areas and creating new topographical
  features is important for understanding of the processes that shape polar areas.
  Several years of HiRISE observations provide us with the information about the current
  rate of erosion and hence help estimate minimum ages of the araneiforms, and the
  surface into which they are carved, to be 1300 Martian years.
