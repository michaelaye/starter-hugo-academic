 abstract = {H.E.S.S.---the high energy stereoscopic system---is a new system
of large atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes for GeV/TeV astronomy.
Each of the four telescopes of 107m2 mirror area is equipped with
a 960-pixel photomultiplier-tube camera. This paper describes the
methods used to convert the photomultiplier signals into the
quantities needed for Cherenkov image analysis. Two independent
calibration techniques have been applied in parallel to provide
an estimation of uncertainties. Results on the long-term
stability of the H.E.S.S. cameras are also presented.},
