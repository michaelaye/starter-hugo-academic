 abstract = {The high-frequency peaked BL Lac PKS 2005-489 () was observed in
2003 and 2004 with the HESS stereoscopic array of imaging
atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia. A signal was
detected at the 6.7$σ$ level in the 2004 observations (24.2
h live time), but not in the 2003 data set (27.3 h live time).
PKS 2005-489 is the first blazar independently discovered by
HESS to be an emitter of VHE photons, and only the second such
blazar in the Southern Hemisphere. The integral flux above 200
GeV observed in 2004 is ( cm-2 s-1, corresponding to ~2.5% of
the flux observed from the Crab Nebula. The 99% upper limit on
the flux in 2003, I(>200 GeV cm-2 s-1, is smaller than the flux
measured in 2004, suggesting an increased level of activity in
2004. However, the data show no evidence for significant
variability on any time scale less than a year. An energy
spectrum is measured and is characterized by a very soft power
law (photon index of ).},
