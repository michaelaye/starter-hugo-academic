 abstract = {We present an overview of our analyses of HiRISE observations of
spring evolution of selected dune areas of the north polar erg.
The north polar erg is covered annually by seasonal volatile ice
layer, a mixture of CO2 and H2O with mineral dust contamination.
In spring, this layer sublimes creating visually enigmatic
phenomena, e.g. dark and bright fan-shaped deposits,
dark--bright--dark bandings, dark down-slope streaks, and
seasonal polygonal cracks. Similar phenomena in southern polar
areas are believed to be related to the specific process of
solid-state greenhouse effect. In the north, it is currently
unclear if the solid-state greenhouse effect is able to explain
all the observed phenomena especially because the increased
influence of H2O on the time scales of this process has not yet
been quantified. HiRISE observations of our selected locations
show that the ground exhibits a temporal behaviour similar to the
one observed in the southern polar areas: a brightening phase
starting close to the spring equinox with a subsequent darkening
towards summer solstice. The resolution of HiRISE enabled us to
study dunes and substrate individually and even distinguish
between different developments on windward and slip face sides of
single dunes. Differences in the seasonal evolution between steep
slip faces and flatter substrate and windward sides of dunes have
been identified and compared to CRISM data of CO2 and H2O
distributions on dunes. We also observe small scale dark blotches
that appear in early observations and tend to sustain a low
reflectivity throughout the spring. These blotches can be
regarded as the analogue of dark fan deposits in southern polar
areas, leading us to the conclusion that both martian polar areas
follow similar spring evolutions.},
