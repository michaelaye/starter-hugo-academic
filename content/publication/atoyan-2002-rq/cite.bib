 abstract = {We present the results of a detailed timing analysis of
observations of Cen X-3 taken by the University of Durham Mark 6
imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope in 1997-1999. The
presence of a TeV gamma -ray signal at the overall >= 4.5sigma
significance level in the ``fully cut'' image selected data, as
reported earlier, is confirmed. A search for possible modulations
of gamma -rays with the pulsar spin period P0~ 4.8 s was
performed by the step-by-step application of image parameter cuts
of gradually increasing hardness. The data of each of 23 days of
observations have not revealed any statistically significant
Rayleigh power peak, except for 1 day when a peak with a chance
probability p=6.8x 10-7 was found in ``soft-cut'' data sets. This
modulation, if real, is blue shifted by 6.6 ms (>103 km s-1) from
the nominal second harmonic of the X-ray pulsar. Taking the large
number of frequency trials into account, the estimated final
probability of finding such a peak by chance still remains = 100
MeV) and very high energy (VHE, E>= 100 GeV) gamma -rays. We
propose on the basis of the energetics required that all
reasonable options for the gamma -ray production in Cen X-3 must
be connected to jets emerging from the inner accretion disc
around the neutron star. One of the principal options is a
large-scale source, with R_s ~ 1013 - 1014 cm; this assumes
effective acceleration of electrons up to ~ 10 TeV by shocks
produced by interaction of these jets with the dense atmosphere
of the binary. It is shown that such a quasi-stationary model
could explain the bulk of the gamma -radiation features observed
except for the gamma -ray modulations with the pulsar spin. These
modulations, if genuine, would require an alternative source with
R_s << 1011 cm. We consider two principal models, hadronic and
leptonic, for the formation of such a compact source in the jet.
Both models predict that the episodes of pulsed gamma -ray
emission may be rather rare, with a typical duration not
exceeding a few hours, and that generally the frequency of
pulsations should be significantly shifted from the nominal
frequency of the X-ray pulsar. The opportunities to distinguish
between different models by means of future gamma -ray
observations of this X-ray binary are also discussed.},
