 abstract = {We analyze a series of targeted CRISM and HiRISE observations of
seven regions of interest at high latitudes in the Northern polar
regions of Mars. These data allow us to investigate the temporal
evolution of the composition of the seasonal ice cap during
spring, with a special emphasis on peculiar phenomena occurring
in the dune fields and in the vicinity of the scarps of the North
Polar Layered Deposits (NPLDs). The strength of the spectral
signature of CO2 ice continuously decreases during spring whereas
the one of H2O ice first shows a strong increase until Ls = 50°.
This evolution is consistent with a scenario previously
established from analysis of OMEGA data, in which a thin layer of
pure H2O ice progressively develops at the surface of the
volatile layer. During early spring (Ls < 10°), widespread jet
activity is observed by HiRISE while strong spectral signatures
of CO2 ice are detected by CRISM. Later, around Ls = 20-40°,
activity concentrates at the dune fields where CRISM also detects
a spectral enrichment in CO2 ice, consistent with ``Kieffer's
model'' (Kieffer, H.H. [2007]. J. Geophys. Res. 112, E08005.
doi:10.1029/2006JE002816) for jet activity. Effects of wind are
prominent across the dune fields and seem to strongly influence
the sublimation of the volatile layer. Strong winds blowing down
the scarps could also be responsible for the significant spatial
and temporal variability of the surface ice composition observed
close to the NPLD.},
