abstract: We analyze a series of targeted CRISM and HiRISE observations of seven regions
  of interest at high latitudes in the Northern polar regions of Mars. These data
  allow us to investigate the temporal evolution of the composition of the seasonal
  ice cap during spring, with a special emphasis on peculiar phenomena occurring in
  the dune fields and in the vicinity of the scarps of the North Polar Layered Deposits
  (NPLDs). The strength of the spectral signature of CO2 ice continuously decreases
  during spring whereas the one of H2O ice first shows a strong increase until Ls
  = 50°. This evolution is consistent with a scenario previously established from
  analysis of OMEGA data, in which a thin layer of pure H2O ice progressively develops
  at the surface of the volatile layer. During early spring (Ls < 10°), widespread
  jet activity is observed by HiRISE while strong spectral signatures of CO2 ice are
  detected by CRISM. Later, around Ls = 20-40°, activity concentrates at the dune
  fields where CRISM also detects a spectral enrichment in CO2 ice, consistent with
  ``Kieffer's model'' (Kieffer, H.H. [2007]. J. Geophys. Res. 112, E08005. doi:10.1029/2006JE002816)
  for jet activity. Effects of wind are prominent across the dune fields and seem
  to strongly influence the sublimation of the volatile layer. Strong winds blowing
  down the scarps could also be responsible for the significant spatial and temporal
  variability of the surface ice composition observed close to the NPLD.
