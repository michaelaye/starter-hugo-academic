 abstract = {The Martian South Polar Regions which are covered by a CO2
layer during winter, become in spring a place for exotic
activity and a place of CO2, water ice and dust interplay. Dark
and bright fans have been observed. They are associated with
araneiform (spider-like) structures and are believed to be
deposits from jets which arise from pressure produced below
translucent CO2 slab ice. The High Resolution Imaging Science
Experiment (HiRISE) has imaged the southern polar terrain in
unprecedented detail throughout local spring of Martian year
28. At the moment (beginning of 2009) a similar observational
campaign for the southern spring of Martian year 29 is being
conducted. We will present HiRISE observations for two chosen
locations that exhibit jet activity - the Giza region (-84.8,
65.7E) and Inca City (-81.3, 295.8E) - and compare their early
spring evolution. Although these two areas are situated at
similar latitudes, they lie on opposite sides of the South Pole
and are topographically quite different: Giza occupies a
relatively flat area, while Inca City possesses a distinctive
set of orthogonal ridges. The most important difference is the
relation of these regions to the cryptic terrain. OMEGA
observations suggest Inca City lies completely outside the
cryptic terrain, while Giza is inside the early cryptic region
(at Ls=220 deg-230 deg). Similarities and differences in the
evolution of these areas will be discussed on the basis of
models of processes involving translucent CO2 ice.},
