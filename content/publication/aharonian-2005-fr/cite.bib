 abstract = {X-ray binaries are composed of a normal star in orbit around a
neutron star or stellar-mass black hole. Radio and x-ray
observations have led to the presumption that some x-ray binaries
called microquasars behave as scaled-down active galactic nuclei.
Microquasars have resolved radio emission that is thought to
arise from a relativistic outflow akin to active galactic nuclei
jets, in which particles can be accelerated to large energies.
Very high energy gamma-rays produced by the interactions of these
particles have been observed from several active galactic nuclei.
Using the High Energy Stereoscopic System, we find evidence for
gamma-ray emission of >100 gigaelectron volts from a candidate
microquasar, LS 5039, showing that particles are also accelerated
to very high energies in these systems.},
