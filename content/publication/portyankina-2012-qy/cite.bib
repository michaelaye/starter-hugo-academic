 abstract = {In this paper, we use morphological and numerical methods to test
the hypothesis that seasonally formed fracture patterns in the
Martian polar regions result from the brittle failure of seasonal
CO2 slab ice. The observations by the High Resolution Imaging
Science Experiment (HiRISE) of polar regions of Mars show very
narrow dark elongated linear patterns that are observed during
some periods of time in spring, disappear in summer and re?appear
again in the following spring. They are repeatedly formed in the
same areas but they do not repeat the exact pattern from year to
year. This leads to the conclusion that they are cracks formed in
the seasonal ice layer. Some of models of seasonal surface
processes rely on the existence of a transparent form of CO2 ice,
so?called slab ice. For the creation of the observed cracks the
ice is required to be a continuous media, not an agglomeration of
relatively separate particles like a firn. The best explanation
for our observations is a slab ice with relatively high
transparency in the visible wavelength range. This transparency
allows a solid state green?house effect to act underneath the ice
sheet raising the pressure by sublimation from below. The trapped
gas creates overpressure and the ice sheet breaks at some point
creating the observed cracks. We show that the times when the
cracks appear are in agreement with the model calculation,
providing one more piece of evidence that CO2 slab ice covers
polar areas in spring.},
