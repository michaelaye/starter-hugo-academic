abstract: In this paper, we use morphological and numerical methods to test the hypothesis
  that seasonally formed fracture patterns in the Martian polar regions result from
  the brittle failure of seasonal CO2 slab ice. The observations by the High Resolution
  Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) of polar regions of Mars show very narrow dark
  elongated linear patterns that are observed during some periods of time in spring,
  disappear in summer and re?appear again in the following spring. They are repeatedly
  formed in the same areas but they do not repeat the exact pattern from year to year.
  This leads to the conclusion that they are cracks formed in the seasonal ice layer.
  Some of models of seasonal surface processes rely on the existence of a transparent
  form of CO2 ice, so?called slab ice. For the creation of the observed cracks the
  ice is required to be a continuous media, not an agglomeration of relatively separate
  particles like a firn. The best explanation for our observations is a slab ice with
  relatively high transparency in the visible wavelength range. This transparency
  allows a solid state green?house effect to act underneath the ice sheet raising
  the pressure by sublimation from below. The trapped gas creates overpressure and
  the ice sheet breaks at some point creating the observed cracks. We show that the
  times when the cracks appear are in agreement with the model calculation, providing
  one more piece of evidence that CO2 slab ice covers polar areas in spring.
