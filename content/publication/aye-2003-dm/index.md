abstract: Scattering values returned by a LIDAR installed at the H.E.S.S. site may
  be used for calculating optical depth profiles. One may then construct model atmospheres
  which fit these using the commercially available MODTRAN atmospheric radiation transfer
  code. Examples of the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the telescope response
  for two characteristic atmospheres are shown.
