 abstract = {Scattering values returned by a LIDAR installed at the H.E.S.S.
site may be used for calculating optical depth profiles. One
may then construct model atmospheres which fit these using the
commercially available MODTRAN atmospheric radiation transfer
code. Examples of the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the
telescope response for two characteristic atmospheres are
shown.},
