abstract: Several atmospheric monitoring devices have been installed at the H.E.S.S.
  site in Namibia. Firstly, Heitronics KT19 infrared radiometers, aligned paraxially
  with the H.E.S.S. telescopes, measure the infrared radiation of the water in clouds
  crossing the telescope field of view. Correlations between the trigger rate of the
  telescope and these IR measurements are shown in this paper. For a general judgment
  of the atmosphere's transmittance, i.e. the detection of any light-attenuating aerosols,
  a ceilometer a LIDAR with built-in atmospheric data reduction code is being used.
  The overall status of the weather is monitored by a fully automated weatherstation.
