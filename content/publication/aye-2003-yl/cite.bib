 abstract = {Several atmospheric monitoring devices have been installed at
the H.E.S.S. site in Namibia. Firstly, Heitronics KT19 infrared
radiometers, aligned paraxially with the H.E.S.S. telescopes,
measure the infrared radiation of the water in clouds crossing
the telescope field of view. Correlations between the trigger
rate of the telescope and these IR measurements are shown in
this paper. For a general judgment of the atmosphere's
transmittance, i.e. the detection of any light-attenuating
aerosols, a ceilometer a LIDAR with built-in atmospheric data
reduction code is being used. The overall status of the weather
is monitored by a fully automated weatherstation.},
