abstract: "We present the results of a systematic mapping of seasonally sculpted terrains\
  \ on the South Polar region of Mars with the Planet Four: Terrains (P4T) online\
  \ citizen science project. P4T enlists members of the general public to visually\
  \ identify features in the publicly released Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context\
  \ Camera (CTX) images. In particular, P4T volunteers are asked to identify: (1)\
  \ araneiforms (including features with a central pit and radiating channels known\
  \ as `spiders'); (2) erosional depressions, troughs, mesas, ridges, and quasi-circular\
  \ pits characteristic of the South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC) which we collectively\
  \ refer to as `Swiss cheese terrain', and (3) craters. In this work we present the\
  \ distributions of our high confidence classic spider araneiforms and Swiss cheese\
  \ terrain identifications in 90 CTX images covering 11% of the South polar regions\
  \ at latitudes $łeq$ −75° N. We find no locations within our high confidence spider\
  \ sample that also have confident Swiss cheese terrain identifications. Previously\
  \ spiders were reported as being confined to the South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD).\
  \ Our work has provided the first identification of spiders at locations outside\
  \ of the SPLD, confirmed with high resolution HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science\
  \ Experiment) imaging. We find araneiforms on the Amazonian and Hesperian polar\
  \ units and the Early Noachian highland units, with 75% of the identified araneiform\
  \ locations in our high confidence sample residing on the SPLD. With our current\
  \ coverage, we cannot confirm whether these are the only geologic units conducive\
  \ to araneiform formation on the Martian South Polar region. Our results are consistent\
  \ with the current CO2 jet formation scenario with the process exploiting weaknesses\
  \ in the surface below the seasonal CO2 ice sheet to carve araneiform channels into\
  \ the regolith over many seasons. These new regions serve as additional probes of\
  \ the conditions required for channel creation in the CO2 jet process."
