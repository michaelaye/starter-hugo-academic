abstract: We discuss theoretical models that could explain the existing data from
  $γ$-ray observations of Cen X-3. Because of the high energetics required, any reasonable
  option for $γ$-ray production in Cen X-3 must be connected with jets emerging from
  the inner accretion disc of the neutron star. A large-scale quasi-stationary source
  (on a time scale of days or longer) powered by shocks driven by such jets into the
  Rs $≥$ 1013 cm surrounding the binary could explain the bulk of the $γ$-radiation
  features, except for a modulation of the $γ$-ray signal with the pulsar spin period.
  These modulations, if genuine, would require an alternative source with Rs 1011
  cm. We consider two principal models, hadronic and leptonic, for such a compact
  source in the jet. Both models predict that the pulsed $γ$-ray emission should be
  episodic, and can be expected only at the initial stages (typically less than a
  few hours) of powerful $γ$-ray flares, and that $γ$-ray pulsations should be significantly
  shifted from the pulsar frequency. Such a source would generally fade, due to expansion,
  in a few days.
