 abstract = {We discuss theoretical models that could explain the existing
data from $γ$-ray observations of Cen X-3. Because of the
high energetics required, any reasonable option for
$γ$-ray production in Cen X-3 must be connected with jets
emerging from the inner accretion disc of the neutron star. A
large-scale quasi-stationary source (on a time scale of days or
longer) powered by shocks driven by such jets into the Rs
$≥$ 1013 cm surrounding the binary could explain the bulk of
the $γ$-radiation features, except for a modulation of the
$γ$-ray signal with the pulsar spin period. These
modulations, if genuine, would require an alternative source
with Rs 1011 cm. We consider two principal models, hadronic and
leptonic, for such a compact source in the jet. Both models
predict that the pulsed $γ$-ray emission should be
episodic, and can be expected only at the initial stages
(typically less than a few hours) of powerful $γ$-ray
flares, and that $γ$-ray pulsations should be
significantly shifted from the pulsar frequency. Such a source
would generally fade, due to expansion, in a few days.},
