is measuring surface temperatures in 7 different thermal
channels, 4 of them in the wavelength area classically defined
as far infrared, starting at 13 microns, and ending with the
longest wavelength channel at 400 microns. The surface
temperatures derived from these thermal infrared measurements at
the lunar poles indicate some of the coldest temperatures
measured in the solar system of around 20 K. This work aims to
disprove the null hypothesis that other effects like wavelength
and temperature dependent emissivities are responsible for a
reduced radiant exitance and the subsequently low derived
surface temperature. To address the wavelength dependency of
emissivity we are comparing nighttime temperatures over time
(cooling curves) in between the different far infrared channels
at selected locations. The locations have to be selected for low
rock abundance to minimize anisothermality effects influencing
the cooling curves. For this we are applying the method of lunar
surface rock abundance using Diviner data as described in
Bandfield et al. (2011), that has not been done so far at
latitudes poleward of 60Â°. To avoid the large influence of
slopes on the surface temperatures, the main reason for the
latitude restriction in Bandfield et al. (2011) we use recent
LOLA altimeter data to resolve any slopes that could influence
the cooling curve at a chosen location. Having selected a
location relatively free of anisothermalities and taking their
effect into account, general differences in the cooling curves
of the different Diviner wavelengths are interpreted as
wavelength-dependent emissivities. To address the potential
temperature dependency of emissivity, we are studying how the
parameters of a mid-temperature range exponential fit to the
cooling curve fit from approx. 250 to 70K, where we do not
expect a temperature dependence of emissivity, extends to
highest and lowest temperatures at the poles. Failure to make
the high or low ends of the cooling curve fit to the
extrapolated shape of the mid-temperature curve indicates a
change of emissivity. Lastly, these studies should compare
locations where we expect a potential emissivity effect from
surface frosts. Chosen locations close to each other and under
the assumption of comparable lateral heat conductivity at these
close locations, surface deposits of ices should have a
measurable effect on the emissivity. Studying this could further
support two of Diviner's exciting hypotheses of water ice
deposits in craters at the pole, and having measured some of the
coldest temperature in the solar system.},
