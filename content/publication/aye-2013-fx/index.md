abstract: The Diviner Radiometer on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is measuring
  surface temperatures in 7 different thermal channels, 4 of them in the wavelength
  area classically defined as far infrared, starting at 13 microns, and ending with
  the longest wavelength channel at 400 microns. The surface temperatures derived
  from these thermal infrared measurements at the lunar poles indicate some of the
  coldest temperatures measured in the solar system of around 20 K. This work aims
  to disprove the null hypothesis that other effects like wavelength and temperature
  dependent emissivities are responsible for a reduced radiant exitance and the subsequently
  low derived surface temperature. To address the wavelength dependency of emissivity
  we are comparing nighttime temperatures over time (cooling curves) in between the
  different far infrared channels at selected locations. The locations have to be
  selected for low rock abundance to minimize anisothermality effects influencing
  the cooling curves. For this we are applying the method of lunar surface rock abundance
  using Diviner data as described in Bandfield et al. (2011), that has not been done
  so far at latitudes poleward of 60Â°. To avoid the large influence of slopes on the
  surface temperatures, the main reason for the latitude restriction in Bandfield
  et al. (2011) we use recent LOLA altimeter data to resolve any slopes that could
  influence the cooling curve at a chosen location. Having selected a location relatively
  free of anisothermalities and taking their effect into account, general differences
  in the cooling curves of the different Diviner wavelengths are interpreted as wavelength-dependent
  emissivities. To address the potential temperature dependency of emissivity, we
  are studying how the parameters of a mid-temperature range exponential fit to the
  cooling curve fit from approx. 250 to 70K, where we do not expect a temperature
  dependence of emissivity, extends to highest and lowest temperatures at the poles.
  Failure to make the high or low ends of the cooling curve fit to the extrapolated
  shape of the mid-temperature curve indicates a change of emissivity. Lastly, these
  studies should compare locations where we expect a potential emissivity effect from
  surface frosts. Chosen locations close to each other and under the assumption of
  comparable lateral heat conductivity at these close locations, surface deposits
  of ices should have a measurable effect on the emissivity. Studying this could further
  support two of Diviner's exciting hypotheses of water ice deposits in craters at
  the pole, and having measured some of the coldest temperature in the solar system.
