 abstract = {The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on board
NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been returning data for 3
Martian years. These data show that Mars is more dynamic than
previously believed. In particular, the high-resolution images
(down to 25 cm/px) have given us new insight into seasonal
processes. When combined with the observations of the CRISM
imagingspectrometer, we begin to obtain a rather detailed
picture of how phenomena develop over time.},
