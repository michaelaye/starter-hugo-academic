abstract: The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on board NASA's
  Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been returning data for 3 Martian years. These data
  show that Mars is more dynamic than previously believed. In particular, the high-resolution
  images (down to 25 cm/px) have given us new insight into seasonal processes. When
  combined with the observations of the CRISM imagingspectrometer, we begin to obtain
  a rather detailed picture of how phenomena develop over time.
