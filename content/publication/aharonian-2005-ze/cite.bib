 abstract = {The Supernova Remnant MSH 15-52 has been observed in very high
energy (VHE) $γ$-rays using the HESS 4-telescope array
located in Namibia. A $γ$-ray signal is detected at the 25
sigma level during an exposure of 22.1 h live time. The image
reveals an elliptically shaped emission region around the pulsar
PSR B1509-58, with semi-major axis ~6' in the NW-SE direction and
semi-minor axis ~2'. This morphology coincides with the diffuse
pulsar wind nebula as observed at X-ray energies by ROSAT. The
overall energy spectrum from 280 GeV up to 40 TeV can be fitted
by a power law with photon index $Γ$=2.27$±$0.03stat$±$
0.20syst. The detected emission can be plausibly explained by
inverse Compton scattering of accelerated relativistic electrons
with soft photons.},
