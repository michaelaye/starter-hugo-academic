abstract: The Mars Simulation wind tunnel at Aarhus University is a unique ESA and
  EU supported simulation facility designed for studies of the Martian environment.
  Specifically it is capable of recreating the key physical parameters such as temperature,
  pressure (composition), wind flow and importantly the suspension of dust particulates.
  This facility is available to the scientific community for collaborative research.
  Preliminary results from the first year of facility operations will be presented.
