 abstract = {The Mars Simulation wind tunnel at Aarhus University is a unique
ESA and EU supported simulation facility designed for studies of
the Martian environment. Specifically it is capable of
recreating the key physical parameters such as temperature,
pressure (composition), wind flow and importantly the suspension
of dust particulates. This facility is available to the
scientific community for collaborative research. Preliminary
results from the first year of facility operations will be
presented.},
