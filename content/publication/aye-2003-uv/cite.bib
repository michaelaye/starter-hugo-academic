 abstract = {We present a novel alternative to the use of glass mirrors on
ground based Cherenkov telescopes. Glass mirrors, whilst having
excellent imaging characteristics, can become a limiting factor
in the design of such telescopes, due to their weight and
expense. We produce mirrors using an innovative vacuum forming
process (global patent applied for), using only aluminium
materials. The result is a mirror weighing and costing a
fraction of that of a glass mirror. The method of production is
described together with preliminary results of the shape
conformity and repro ducibility. The properties of the
reflective surface are outlined, including robustness and
specular reflectivity. This is shown to be superior to its
glass equivalent particularly at wavelengths relevant to
Cherenkov radiation.},
