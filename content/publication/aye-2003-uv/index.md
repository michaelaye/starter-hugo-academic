abstract: We present a novel alternative to the use of glass mirrors on ground based
  Cherenkov telescopes. Glass mirrors, whilst having excellent imaging characteristics,
  can become a limiting factor in the design of such telescopes, due to their weight
  and expense. We produce mirrors using an innovative vacuum forming process (global
  patent applied for), using only aluminium materials. The result is a mirror weighing
  and costing a fraction of that of a glass mirror. The method of production is described
  together with preliminary results of the shape conformity and repro ducibility.
  The properties of the reflective surface are outlined, including robustness and
  specular reflectivity. This is shown to be superior to its glass equivalent particularly
  at wavelengths relevant to Cherenkov radiation.
