abstract: Mkn 421 was observed during a high flux state for nine nights in April and
  May 2004 with the fully operational High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) in Namibia.
  The observations were carried out at zenith angles of 60°-65°, which result in an
  average energy threshold of 1.5 TeV and a collection area reaching 2 km2 at 10 TeV.
  Roughly 7000 photons from Mkn 421 were accumulated with an average gamma-ray rate
  of 8 photons/min. The overall significance of the detection exceeds 100 standard
  deviations. The light-curve of integrated fluxes above 2 TeV shows changes of the
  diurnal flux up to a factor of 4.3. For nights of high flux, intra-night variability
  is detected with a decay time of less than 1 h. The time averaged energy spectrum
  is curved and is well described by a power-law with a photon index $Γ$=2.1$±$0.1stat$±$0.3sys
  and an exponential cutoff at Ec=3.1(+0.5 -0.4)stat$±$0.9sys TeV and an average integral
  flux above 2 TeV of 3 Crab flux units. Significant variations of the spectral shape
  are detected with a spectral hardening as the flux increases. Contemporaneous multi-wavelength
  observations at lower energies (X-rays and gamma-rays above $≈$300 GeV) indicate
  smaller relative variability amplitudes than seen above 2 TeV during high flux state
  observed in April 2004.
