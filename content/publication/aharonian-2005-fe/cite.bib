 abstract = {Mkn 421 was observed during a high flux state for nine nights in
April and May 2004 with the fully operational High Energy
Stereoscopic System (HESS) in Namibia. The observations were
carried out at zenith angles of 60°-65°, which result in an
average energy threshold of 1.5 TeV and a collection area
reaching 2 km2 at 10 TeV. Roughly 7000 photons from Mkn 421 were
accumulated with an average gamma-ray rate of 8 photons/min. The
overall significance of the detection exceeds 100 standard
deviations. The light-curve of integrated fluxes above 2 TeV
shows changes of the diurnal flux up to a factor of 4.3. For
nights of high flux, intra-night variability is detected with a
decay time of less than 1 h. The time averaged energy spectrum is
curved and is well described by a power-law with a photon index
$Γ$=2.1$±$0.1stat$±$0.3sys and an exponential cutoff at
Ec=3.1(+0.5 -0.4)stat$±$0.9sys TeV and an average integral flux
above 2 TeV of 3 Crab flux units. Significant variations of the
spectral shape are detected with a spectral hardening as the flux
increases. Contemporaneous multi-wavelength observations at lower
energies (X-rays and gamma-rays above $≈$300 GeV) indicate
smaller relative variability amplitudes than seen above 2 TeV
during high flux state observed in April 2004.},
