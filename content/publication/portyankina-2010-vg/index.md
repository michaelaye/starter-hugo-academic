abstract: "The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance\
  \ Or-biter (MRO) is presently (February 2010) observing its second northern spring\
  \ on Mars. Com-plimentary spectral information from CRISM is available to gain insight\
  \ into the composition and physical state of the surface. In the north polar areas,\
  \ there are active regions. Here, dark dunes extend almost circumferen-tially around\
  \ the permanent polar cap. This area exhibits phenomena similar to those observed\
  \ in south polar areas in southern spring. Among these phenomena are cracks in a\
  \ translucent ice layer which are considered to be manifestations of ice damage\
  \ by increasing pressure at the interface between the ice layer and substrate underlying\
  \ it [1]. Bright and dark fans, attributed to cold jet activity, are also observed\
  \ on top of dunes [2]. The presence of these features indi-cates that dunes are\
  \ covered by a conformal ice layer and that this layer is at least partially transparent\
  \ to solar radiation. CO2 ice sublimation and processes connected to it appear to\
  \ produce a variety of observable features. Yet another distinctive feature observed\
  \ in this area (and rarely present in the south) is the presence of dark slope streaks\
  \ on dunes. They originate from the crests of dunes and run down following the gravitational\
  \ potential. They lengthen as the season progresses. Their origin has been discussed\
  \ to be possible liquid brine flows [3, 4]. In the present work we report on indications\
  \ that these slope streaks are instead dry mass wasting process. Due to geometry\
  \ of solar illumination at local latitude the energy input on the crest is higher\
  \ than in the valley between dunes. The ice cover thins most quickly in areas closest\
  \ to the crest. In addition, applying stress distribution calculations to the conformal\
  \ ice layer on realistic dune geometry, we show that the crest of the dune is the\
  \ weakest point for the ice bending stress. The rupture of the ice layer therefore\
  \ happens close to the dune's crest on the slip face and is followed by the escape\
  \ of dry dune material from its top layer downslope. Streaks are overlaid on the\
  \ ice layer and produce the observed contrast changes. Seasonal lengthening of the\
  \ streaks can be attributed to the repeatability of this process when more and more\
  \ dune material gets freed from the ice layer. An enhancement of this effect can\
  \ occur if the rupture of the ice layer gives rise to an escape of gas trapped under\
  \ it. The gas pressure, in this case, is produced by the same process that is proposed\
  \ for araneiform formation in south polar areas [5]. Gas movement mobilises fine\
  \ dune material and transports it towards the slip slope whereupon it runs down\
  \ the slope. The described model does not involve liquid flows but is nonetheless\
  \ fully consistent with HiRISE observations of this phenomenon. [1] G. Portyankina\
