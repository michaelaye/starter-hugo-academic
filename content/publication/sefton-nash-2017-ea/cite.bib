 abstract = {An approach is presented to efficiently produce high quality
gridded data records from the large, global point-based dataset
returned by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment aboard NASA's
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The need to minimize data volume
and processing time in production of science-ready map products
is increasingly important with the growth in data volume of
planetary datasets. Diviner makes on average >1400 observations
per second of radiance that is reflected and emitted from the
lunar surface, using 189 detectors divided into 9 spectral
channels. Data management and processing bottlenecks are
amplified by modeling every observation as a probability
distribution function over the field of view, which can increase
the required processing time by 2--3 orders of magnitude.
Geometric corrections, such as projection of data points onto a
digital elevation model, are numerically intensive and therefore
it is desirable to perform them only once. Our approach reduces
bottlenecks through parallel binning and efficient storage of a
pre-processed database of observations. Database construction is
via subdivision of a geodesic icosahedral grid, with a spatial
resolution that can be tailored to suit the field of view of the
observing instrument. Global geodesic grids with high spatial
resolution are normally impractically memory intensive. We
therefore demonstrate a minimum storage and highly parallel
method to bin very large numbers of data points onto such a grid.
A database of the pre-processed and binned points is then used
for production of mapped data products that is significantly
faster than if unprocessed points were used. We explore quality
controls in the production of gridded data records by conditional
interpolation, allowed only where data density is sufficient. The
resultant effects on the spatial continuity and uncertainty in
maps of lunar brightness temperatures is illustrated. We identify
four binning regimes based on trades between the spatial
resolution of the grid, the size of the FOV and the on-target
spacing of observations. Our approach may be applicable and
beneficial for many existing and future point-based planetary
datasets.},
