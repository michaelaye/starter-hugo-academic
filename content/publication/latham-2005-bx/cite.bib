 abstract = {The link between the physical processes responsible for high
energy emission from relativistic jets in AGN and microquasars
is investigated. A Fortran code based on an existing
inhomogeneous, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, for AGN is
presented. The code is then applied to the AGN 3C 279 and the
microquasar LS5039. Spectral energy distributions (SED's) are
presented.},
