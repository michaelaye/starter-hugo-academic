abstract: The link between the physical processes responsible for high energy emission
  from relativistic jets in AGN and microquasars is investigated. A Fortran code based
  on an existing inhomogeneous, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, for AGN is presented.
  The code is then applied to the AGN 3C 279 and the microquasar LS5039. Spectral
  energy distributions (SED's) are presented.
