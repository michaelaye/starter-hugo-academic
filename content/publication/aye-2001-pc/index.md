abstract: Simulations have been made of the response of the Durham Mark 6 atmospheric
  Cherenkov telescope to air showers generated by ALTAI, CORSIKA and MOCCA codes.
  Comparisons are made between the simulations and real data. The effective collection
  area of gamma ray showers, including the retention factor is derived as a function
  of energy. On the basis of this work the flux of the AGN PKS 2155-304 above 1.5TeV
  is derived to be 2.1 $±$ 0.2syst $±$ 0.5stat $times$ 10-7 m-2 s-1 .
