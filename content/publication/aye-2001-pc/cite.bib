 abstract = {Simulations have been made of the response of the Durham Mark 6
atmospheric Cherenkov telescope to air showers generated by
ALTAI, CORSIKA and MOCCA codes. Comparisons are made between
the simulations and real data. The effective collection area of
gamma ray showers, including the retention factor is derived as
a function of energy. On the basis of this work the flux of the
AGN PKS 2155-304 above 1.5TeV is derived to be 2.1 $±$
0.2syst $±$ 0.5stat $\times$ 10-7 m-2 s-1 .},
