abstract: 'A significant fraction of the energy density of the interstellar medium
  is in the form of high-energy charged particles (cosmic rays). The origin of these
  particles remains uncertain. Although it is generally accepted that the only sources
  capable of supplying the energy required to accelerate the bulk of Galactic cosmic
  rays are supernova explosions, and even though the mechanism of particle acceleration
  in expanding supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is thought to be well understood theoretically,
  unequivocal evidence for the production of high-energy particles in supernova shells
  has proven remarkably hard to find. Here we report on observations of the SNR RX
  J1713.7 - 3946 (G347.3 - 0.5), which was discovered by ROSAT in the X-ray spectrum
  and later claimed as a source of high-energy gamma-rays of TeV energies (1 TeV =
  10(12) eV). We present a TeV gamma-ray image of the SNR: the spatially resolved
  remnant has a shell morphology similar to that seen in X-rays, which demonstrates
  that very-high-energy particles are accelerated there. The energy spectrum indicates
  efficient acceleration of charged particles to energies beyond 100 TeV, consistent
  with current ideas of particle acceleration in young SNR shocks.'
