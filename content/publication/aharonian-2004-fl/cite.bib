 abstract = {A significant fraction of the energy density of the interstellar
medium is in the form of high-energy charged particles (cosmic
rays). The origin of these particles remains uncertain. Although
it is generally accepted that the only sources capable of
supplying the energy required to accelerate the bulk of Galactic
cosmic rays are supernova explosions, and even though the
mechanism of particle acceleration in expanding supernova remnant
(SNR) shocks is thought to be well understood theoretically,
unequivocal evidence for the production of high-energy particles
in supernova shells has proven remarkably hard to find. Here we
report on observations of the SNR RX J1713.7 - 3946 (G347.3 -
0.5), which was discovered by ROSAT in the X-ray spectrum and
later claimed as a source of high-energy gamma-rays of TeV
energies (1 TeV = 10(12) eV). We present a TeV gamma-ray image of
the SNR: the spatially resolved remnant has a shell morphology
similar to that seen in X-rays, which demonstrates that
very-high-energy particles are accelerated there. The energy
spectrum indicates efficient acceleration of charged particles to
energies beyond 100 TeV, consistent with current ideas of
particle acceleration in young SNR shocks.},
