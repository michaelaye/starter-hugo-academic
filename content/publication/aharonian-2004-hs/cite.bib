 abstract = {We report the detection of a point-like source of very high
energy (VHE) $γ$-rays coincident within 1' of Sgr A*,
obtained with the HESS array of Cherenkov telescopes. The
$γ$-rays exhibit a power-law energy spectrum with a spectral
index of -2.2 $±$ 0.09 $±$ 0.15 and a flux above the 165 GeV
threshold of (1.82 $±$ 0.22) $\times$ 10-7 m-2 s-1. The
measured flux and spectrum differ substantially from recent
results reported in particular by the CANGAROO collaboration.},
