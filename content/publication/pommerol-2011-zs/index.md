abstract: 'We use data from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE)
  camera and the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) imaging
  spectrometer onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to follow the evolution of
  the appearance and composition of 12 regions of the south polar layered deposits
  from spring to summer time. We distinguish three steps in the evolution of the volatile
  layer: a decrease of both CO2 band strength and albedo until Ls = 190°?210°, a significant
  increase in both until Ls = 240°?260° and finally a rapid decrease until the complete
  defrosting of the ground. In contrast, the water ice band displays a more monotonic
  decrease. Analysis of HiRISE color images acquired simultaneously with CRISM data
  allows a plausible interpretation of this evolution. In early springtime (Ls < 200°),
  intense jet activity results in deposition of fans of large mineral grains and a
  wide spatial distribution of fine grains. The small?scale topography controls the
  presence and location of the jets by allowing more solar energy to be collected
  on slopes. Grains from the dust fans warm and sink through the CO2 layer, resulting
  in a bluish color at the locations of the fans around Ls = 190°?210°. As the atmosphere
  warms up, the surface of the ice layer sublimes and releases dust and water, resulting
  in its brightening. The last phase of the process consists in a progressive defrosting
  resulting in a patchwork of frozen and unfrozen areas.'
