 abstract = {We use data from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment
(HiRISE) camera and the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging
Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) imaging spectrometer onboard the
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to follow the evolution of the
appearance and composition of 12 regions of the south polar
layered deposits from spring to summer time. We distinguish three
steps in the evolution of the volatile layer: a decrease of both
CO2 band strength and albedo until Ls = 190°?210°, a significant
increase in both until Ls = 240°?260° and finally a rapid
decrease until the complete defrosting of the ground. In
contrast, the water ice band displays a more monotonic decrease.
Analysis of HiRISE color images acquired simultaneously with
CRISM data allows a plausible interpretation of this evolution.
In early springtime (Ls < 200°), intense jet activity results in
deposition of fans of large mineral grains and a wide spatial
distribution of fine grains. The small?scale topography controls
the presence and location of the jets by allowing more solar
energy to be collected on slopes. Grains from the dust fans warm
and sink through the CO2 layer, resulting in a bluish color at
the locations of the fans around Ls = 190°?210°. As the
atmosphere warms up, the surface of the ice layer sublimes and
releases dust and water, resulting in its brightening. The last
phase of the process consists in a progressive defrosting
resulting in a patchwork of frozen and unfrozen areas.},
