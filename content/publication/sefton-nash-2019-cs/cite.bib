 abstract = {The northern floor and wall of Amundsen crater, near the lunar
south pole, is a permanently shaded region (PSR). Previous study
of this area using data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter
(LOLA), Diviner and LAMP instruments aboard Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter (LRO) shows a spatial correlation between brighter 1064
nm albedo, annual maximum surface temperatures low enough to
enable persistence of surface water ice (<110 K), and anomalous
ultraviolet radiation. We present results using data from Diviner
that quantify the differential emissivities observed in the
far-IR (near the Planck peak for PSR-relevant temperatures)
between the PSR and a nearby non-PSR target in Amundsen Crater.
We find features in far-IR emissivity (50--400 $Î¼$m) could be
attributed to either, or a combination, of two effects (i)
differential regolith emissive behavior between
permanently-shadowed temperature regimes and those of normally
illuminated polar terrain, perhaps related to presence of water
frost (as indicated in other studies), or (ii) high degrees of
anisothermality within observation fields of view caused by
doubly-shaded areas within the PSR target that are colder than
observed brightness temperatures. The implications in both cases
are compelling: The far-IR emissivity curve of lunar cold traps
may provide a metric for the abundance of ``micro'' cold traps
that are ultra-cool, i.e. shadowed also from secondary and higher
order radiation (absorption and re-radiation or scattering by
surrounding terrain), or for emissive properties consistent with
the presence of surface water ice.},
