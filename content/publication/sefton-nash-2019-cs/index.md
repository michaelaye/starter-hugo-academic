abstract: "The northern floor and wall of Amundsen crater, near the lunar south pole,\
  \ is a permanently shaded region (PSR). Previous study of this area using data from\
  \ the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), Diviner and LAMP instruments aboard\
  \ Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) shows a spatial correlation between brighter\
  \ 1064 nm albedo, annual maximum surface temperatures low enough to enable persistence\
  \ of surface water ice (<110 K), and anomalous ultraviolet radiation. We present\
  \ results using data from Diviner that quantify the differential emissivities observed\
  \ in the far-IR (near the Planck peak for PSR-relevant temperatures) between the\
  \ PSR and a nearby non-PSR target in Amundsen Crater. We find features in far-IR\
  \ emissivity (50--400 $Î¼$m) could be attributed to either, or a combination, of\
  \ two effects (i) differential regolith emissive behavior between permanently-shadowed\
  \ temperature regimes and those of normally illuminated polar terrain, perhaps related\
  \ to presence of water frost (as indicated in other studies), or (ii) high degrees\
  \ of anisothermality within observation fields of view caused by doubly-shaded areas\
  \ within the PSR target that are colder than observed brightness temperatures. The\
  \ implications in both cases are compelling: The far-IR emissivity curve of lunar\
  \ cold traps may provide a metric for the abundance of ``micro'' cold traps that\
  \ are ultra-cool, i.e. shadowed also from secondary and higher order radiation (absorption\
  \ and re-radiation or scattering by surrounding terrain), or for emissive properties\
  \ consistent with the presence of surface water ice."
