 abstract = {We report the discovery of very-high-energy (VHE) $γ$-ray
emission of the binary system PSR B1259-63/SS 2883 of a radio
pulsar orbiting a massive, luminous Be star in a highly eccentric
orbit. The observations around the 2004 periastron passage of the
pulsar were performed with the four 13 m Cherenkov telescopes of
the HESS experiment, recently installed in Namibia and in full
operation since December 2003. Between February and June 2004, a
$γ$-ray signal from the binary system was detected with a
total significance above 13$σ$. The flux was found to vary
significantly on timescales of days which makes PSR B1259-63 the
first variable galactic source of VHE $γ$-rays observed so
far. Strong emission signals were observed in pre- and
post-periastron phases with a flux minimum around periastron,
followed by a gradual flux decrease in the months after. The
measured time-averaged energy spectrum above a mean threshold
energy of 380 GeV can be fitted by a simple power law F_0(E/1
TeV)-$Γ$ with a photon index $Γ$ =
2.7$±$0.2_stat$±$0.2_sys and flux normalisation F0 = (1.3
$±$ 0.1_stat $±$ 0.3_sys) $\times$ 10-12 TeV-1 cm-2 s-1.
This detection of VHE $γ$-rays provides unambiguous evidence
for particle acceleration to multi-TeV energies in the binary
system. In combination with coeval observations of the X-ray
synchrotron emission by the RXTE and INTEGRAL instruments, and
assuming the VHE $γ$-ray emission to be produced by the
inverse Compton mechanism, the magnetic field strength can be
directly estimated to be of the order of 1 G.},
