 abstract = {The high-frequency peaked BL Lac PKS 2155-304 at redshift z=0.117
has been detected with high significance (˜45$σ$) at
energies greater than 160 GeV, using the H.E.S.S. stereoscopic
array of imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia. A strong
signal is found in each of the data sets corresponding to the
dark periods of July and October, 2002, and June-September, 2003.
The observed flux of VHE gamma rays shows variability on time
scales of months, days, and hours. The monthly-averaged integral
flux above 300 GeV varies between 10% and 60% of the flux
observed from the Crab Nebula. Energy spectra are measured for
these individual periods of data taking and are characterized by
a steep power law with a time-averaged photon index of
$Γ$=3.32$±$0.06. An improved $χ$2 per degree of freedom
is found when either a power law with an exponential cutoff
energy or a broken power law are fit to the time-averaged energy
spectrum. However, the significance of the improvement is
marginal (˜2$σ$). The suggested presence of features in the
energy spectrum may be intrinsic to the emission from the blazar,
or an indication of absorption of TeV gamma rays by the
extragalactic infrared background light},
