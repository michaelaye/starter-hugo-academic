 abstract = {The springtime sublimation process of Mars' southern seasonal
polar CO2 ice cap features dark fan-shaped deposits appearing on
the top of the thawing ice sheet. The fan material likely
originates from the surface below the ice sheet, brought up via
CO2 jets breaking through the seasonal ice cap. Once the dust and
dirt is released into the atmosphere, the material may be blown
by the surface winds into the dark streaks visible from orbit.
The location, size and direction of these fans record a number of
parameters important to quantifying seasonal winds and
sublimation activity, the most important agent of geological
change extant on Mars. We present results of a systematic mapping
of these south polar seasonal fans with the Planet Four online
citizen science project. Planet Four enlists the general public
to map the shapes, directions, and sizes of the seasonal fans
visible in orbital images. Over 80,000 volunteers have
contributed to the Planet Four project, reviewing 221 images,
from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE (High Resolution
Imaging Science Experiment) camera, taken in southern spring
during Mars Years 29 and 30. We provide an overview of Planet
Four and detail the processes of combining multiple volunteer
assessments together to generate a high fidelity catalog of âˆ¼
400000 south polar seasonal fans. We present the results from
analyzing the wind directions at several locations monitored by
HiRISE over two Mars years, providing new insights into polar
surface winds.},
