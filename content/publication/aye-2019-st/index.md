abstract: The springtime sublimation process of Mars' southern seasonal polar CO2
  ice cap features dark fan-shaped deposits appearing on the top of the thawing ice
  sheet. The fan material likely originates from the surface below the ice sheet,
  brought up via CO2 jets breaking through the seasonal ice cap. Once the dust and
  dirt is released into the atmosphere, the material may be blown by the surface winds
  into the dark streaks visible from orbit. The location, size and direction of these
  fans record a number of parameters important to quantifying seasonal winds and sublimation
  activity, the most important agent of geological change extant on Mars. We present
  results of a systematic mapping of these south polar seasonal fans with the Planet
  Four online citizen science project. Planet Four enlists the general public to map
  the shapes, directions, and sizes of the seasonal fans visible in orbital images.
  Over 80,000 volunteers have contributed to the Planet Four project, reviewing 221
  images, from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science
  Experiment) camera, taken in southern spring during Mars Years 29 and 30. We provide
  an overview of Planet Four and detail the processes of combining multiple volunteer
  assessments together to generate a high fidelity catalog of âˆ¼ 400000 south polar
  seasonal fans. We present the results from analyzing the wind directions at several
  locations monitored by HiRISE over two Mars years, providing new insights into polar
  surface winds.

summary: This paper describes the reduction pipeline of surface markings of the Citizen Science project Planet Four
  into a catalog of geo-located fan and blotch objects. Planet Four enlists the general public to map
  the shapes, directions, and sizes of the seasonal fans visible in orbital images.
