 abstract = {We present a method for calibrating images acquired by the Dawn
Framing Camera (FC) that is based on the results of an in-flight
calibration campaign performed during the cruise from Earth to
Vesta. We describe this campaign and the data analysis in full.
Both the primary camera FC2 and the backup camera FC1 are
radiometrically and geometrically calibrated through observations
of standard stars, star fields, and Solar System objects. The
calibration in each spectral filter is accurate to within a few
percent for point sources. Geometric distortion, small by design,
is characterized with high accuracy. Dark current, monitored on a
regular basis, is very low at flight operational temperatures.
Out-of-field stray light was characterized using the Sun as a
stray light source. In-field stray light is confirmed in
narrow-band filter images of Vesta. Its magnitude and
distribution are scene-dependent, and expected to contribute
significantly to images of extended objects. Description of a
method for in-field stray light correction is deferred to a
follow-up paper, as is a discussion of the closely related topic
of flat-fielding.},
