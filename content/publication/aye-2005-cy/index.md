abstract: Several atmospheric monitoring instruments have been installed at the H.E.S.S.
  gamma-ray observatory in Namibia. Firstly, Heitronics KT19 infrared radiometers,
  aligned paraxially with the H.E.S.S. telescopes, measure the infrared radiation
  of the water molecules. These allow us to detect clouds crossing the telescopes'
  field of view and to estimate the humidity present in the atmosphere. For a general
  estimate of the atmosphere's transmittance, i.e. the detection of any light-attenuating
  aerosols, a ceilometer, which is a LIDAR with built-in atmospheric data reduction
  code, is being used. It will be complemented soon by an instrument which will measure
  the transmissivity of the atmosphere at different wavelengths up to 500m above the
  ground. The overall status of the weather is monitored by a fully automated weatherstation.
  This paper describes the setup, the data analysis and how this will be used in order
  to improve the knowledge of the telescopes' effective collection area.
