 abstract = {Several atmospheric monitoring instruments have been installed
at the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray observatory in Namibia. Firstly,
Heitronics KT19 infrared radiometers, aligned paraxially with
the H.E.S.S. telescopes, measure the infrared radiation of the
water molecules. These allow us to detect clouds crossing the
telescopes' field of view and to estimate the humidity present
in the atmosphere. For a general estimate of the atmosphere's
transmittance, i.e. the detection of any light-attenuating
aerosols, a ceilometer, which is a LIDAR with built-in
atmospheric data reduction code, is being used. It will be
complemented soon by an instrument which will measure the
transmissivity of the atmosphere at different wavelengths up to
500m above the ground. The overall status of the weather is
monitored by a fully automated weatherstation. This paper
describes the setup, the data analysis and how this will be
used in order to improve the knowledge of the telescopes'
effective collection area.},
