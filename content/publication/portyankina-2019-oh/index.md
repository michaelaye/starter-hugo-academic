abstract: We have experimentally investigated CO2 ice condensation under conditions
  similar to those expected in the Martian polar areas using the Environmental Wind
  Tunnel of Aarhus University in the framework of Trans-National Access opportunities
  within the EuroPlanet Research Infrastructure. Our goal was to condense CO2 directly
  from the chamber's atmosphere onto a specially designed cooling plate. We investigated
  ranges of temperatures and pressures similar to those in Martian polar areas, observed
  the texture of the created CO2 ice layer, and measured its optical properties. Most
  importantly, we find that under conditions usual for Martian polar areas in fall
  and winter, CO2 ice always deposits as a translucent slab. The maximum thickness
  of the ice that we have achieved approached 2 cm and this CO2 slab ice layer was
  either transparent or highly translucent. Under significantly lower temperatures
  or in states away from equilibrium (for example, when CO2 gas input into the chamber
  was fast and created over-pressure) CO2 deposited as different crystalline structures.
  In this case, when a thick layer was created, it was not visually transparent. However,
  even in those cases it still retains some level of translucency. Our results will
  advance the analysis of remote-sensing data related to CO2 ice, Mars' seasonal cycles,
  and various models considering CO2 ice condensation-sublimation related processes.
