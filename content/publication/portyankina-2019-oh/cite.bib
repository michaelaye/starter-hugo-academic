 abstract = {We have experimentally investigated CO2 ice condensation under
conditions similar to those expected in the Martian polar areas
using the Environmental Wind Tunnel of Aarhus University in the
framework of Trans-National Access opportunities within the
EuroPlanet Research Infrastructure. Our goal was to condense CO2
directly from the chamber's atmosphere onto a specially designed
cooling plate. We investigated ranges of temperatures and
pressures similar to those in Martian polar areas, observed the
texture of the created CO2 ice layer, and measured its optical
properties. Most importantly, we find that under conditions usual
for Martian polar areas in fall and winter, CO2 ice always
deposits as a translucent slab. The maximum thickness of the ice
that we have achieved approached 2 cm and this CO2 slab ice layer
was either transparent or highly translucent. Under significantly
lower temperatures or in states away from equilibrium (for
example, when CO2 gas input into the chamber was fast and created
over-pressure) CO2 deposited as different crystalline structures.
In this case, when a thick layer was created, it was not visually
transparent. However, even in those cases it still retains some
level of translucency. Our results will advance the analysis of
remote-sensing data related to CO2 ice, Mars' seasonal cycles,
and various models considering CO2 ice condensation-sublimation
related processes.},
