 abstract = {Preliminary tests of an alternative calibration system for the
H.E.S.S. telescope array show that it is possible to replace
the currently operating UV-Laser device with an optical LED
apparatus. Together with complementary optics, it is able to
simulate the Cherenkov flashes, while at the same time
illuminating the whole of the telescope's camera uniformly. The
device in question is capable of driving a fixed number of
specifically chosen LEDs to produce frequent flashes of very
short duration similar to the Cherenkov emission generated by
electromagnetic cascades. The design of the system continues to
be refined. We describe the components and the operation of the
device as developed so far.},
