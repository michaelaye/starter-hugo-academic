abstract: Preliminary tests of an alternative calibration system for the H.E.S.S.
  telescope array show that it is possible to replace the currently operating UV-Laser
  device with an optical LED apparatus. Together with complementary optics, it is
  able to simulate the Cherenkov flashes, while at the same time illuminating the
  whole of the telescope's camera uniformly. The device in question is capable of
  driving a fixed number of specifically chosen LEDs to produce frequent flashes of
  very short duration similar to the Cherenkov emission generated by electromagnetic
  cascades. The design of the system continues to be refined. We describe the components
  and the operation of the device as developed so far.
